            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Aſſembly</hi> July <hi>21. 1652. Reviewed and refuted, &amp;c.</hi> came abroad in Print, there were differing thoughts about it, amongſt theſe who are concerned to anſwer it. Some ſaid that it was not worth an anſwer, others knowing that it did indeed more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with calumnies and reproaches then with arguments, yet, did judge it fit to he anſwered, becauſe in this corrupt age calumnies paſſe for truths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the generality of people without any ſerious diſquiſition and examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Within very few dayes after that Paper was publiſhed, an Anſwer was drawn by one who favoureth the Cauſe of the Proteſters, and was by him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended preſently for the Preſſe; But there it was delayed, and upon good grounds the Review of the Vindication of the pretended Aſſembly at St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> and <hi>Dundee</hi> had the precedency in the Preſſe: for the validity of the Proteſtation lately made at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> doth much depend upon the nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of that Aſſembly, which was aſſerted and well proved in that Review; And the Writer of that Paper (I mean the Review of the Proteſtation made at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to which the Anſwer was intended) did ſo hyperbolically commend that Vindication of the Aſſembly at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Dundee</hi> as <hi>a Nervous Piece, not yet anſwered, nor eaſily anſwerable,</hi> beſide diverſe other expreſſions about it, and did ſo often refer unto it in his Review, that it was eaſie to perceive that no anſwer would be accounted ſatisfactory, if that Vindication were not firſt anſwered and publiſhed that ſober and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men might ſee whether there was ſo great cauſe of boaſting of that Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication or not, and to give ſuch Publick provocations in Print, calling for an Anſwer to it; beſide that, there was information that a courſe was taken by ſome of thoſe that maintain the Publick Reſolutions for Printing the Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Aſſembly at <hi>London,</hi> which was very true for it was Printed there in the year <hi>1652.</hi> After the Review of the Vindication was Printed; this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was a while ſtopped at the Preſſe for want of licence to Print it, and as ſome things which were in the Copy which was at firſt intended for the Preſſe were left out, ſo other things emergent were added. The Reviewer of the Proteſtation doth in the beginning of his Paper refer to a Declaration made at the pretended Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> which you will find to be firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb facs="tcp:102069:3"/>here; and becauſe it abounds with reproaches and miſ-informations, therefore there was a neceſſity to inſiſt the more largely in matters of fact.

I deſire not to prejudice the Reader by a Preface, onely this much I would ſay further, that whereas this Reviewer boaſtes that the gray headed and aged men for the moſt part are on their ſide, to which there is enough anſwered in this Treatiſe; Yet I would have it remembered that the ſame Argument is uſed by <hi>Eliphaz</hi> the <hi>Temanite</hi> againſt <hi>Job. chap. 15. v. 9, 10. What knoweſt thou that we know not? What underſtandeſt thou which is not in us?

                     <p>TO judge of any mans everlaſting eſtate by his temporal out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakings, or his intentions by the outſide of h s actions, as it is to encroach upon things ſecret which belong unto God, and to walk uncharitably towards men, ſo it is not the path which the Proteſte s have troden, and it is but a groundles inſinuation to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt it of them, they know, and do acknowledge, that many of the Lords Precious Ones before their effectual calling are amongſt the worſt of out-breakers, and that ſome of them even after they are made partakers of the Grace of God, fall into grievous ſins; yet do
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102069:5"/>not theſe things bar them, or cut them off from the mercy of God, whoſe election is according to Grace; and therefore the Proteſters have not denied the Teſtimony of gracious men to not a few of theſe whoſe hand (alas for it!) is deep in the provocation; they know alſo how to diſtinguiſh, and have diſtinguiſhed betwixt the condition of the work, and the intention of the worker, and think charitably of the one, whileſt they condemn the other: yet theſe things hinder them not to diſcern betwixt the righteous and the wicked; him that ſerves God, and him that ſerves him not: the Lord hath taught us that falſe Prophets may be known by their fruits, and that men do not gather grapes of thorns, nor figs of thiſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.16.20. <hi>The tranſgreſſion of the wicked ſaith within mine heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes, Pſa.</hi> 36.1. As I dare not judge of any mans everlaſting eſtate, but leave it unto him with whom the books are; ſo have I not ſo learned Chriſt as ſome men would have it, to put no difference amongſt the Profeſſors of the Goſpel, but to call them all godly though eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, and walking contrary to the Goſpel. That the Aſſembly at <hi>S. Andrews</hi> and <hi>Dundee</hi> was owned of God, and that He all along in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedor did guide their Pens, as my ſoul cannot away with that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion to ſubſcribe to it, ſo I fear it is more then the Lord will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low any man to ſay. 1. Becauſe that Aſſembly did ſay, a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy to theſe concerning whom the Lord ſpoke to his Prophet with a ſtrong hand, and inſtructed him that he ſhould not ſay, A confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy to them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.11, 12. And therefore, although they did aſſociat themſelves, yet they did fall and fall together, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.3. The ſad diſpenſation of their ruin being in the begining thereof at <hi>Innerkithen</hi> in Providence tryſted with the begining of that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and afterward more fully accompliſhed and perfected at other places, as they, and their Comm ſſion went on in ratifying of theſe Reſolutions, and cenſuring the oppoſers of the ſame, and iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Warnings and Declarations in reference to theſe things. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Aſſembly was ſo far from rejoycing the hearts, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving themſelves unto the conſciences of moſt of the godly in the Land, or from leaving this ſeal and impreſſion upon their hearts that they had the image and authority of Jeſus Chriſt, and did proceed according to the Law and the Teſtimony, and employ their power unto edification and promoting of godlineſs; that upon the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102069:6"/>contrary they did exceedingly ſadden their ſpirits and leave a deep and ſtrong conviction thereupon, that they did add unto the Lands provocation and encreaſe wrath, and that in moſt of all their act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they did walk not unto edification, but unto deſtruct on. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their actings did rejoyce the hearts and ſtrengthen the hands of theſe in the Land who were void of Grace and of the knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt, and adverſaries to the Cauſe and People of God, and mockers and haters of Piety and Godlineſs. Was not that Aſſembly countenanced and pleaded for? and is it not to this day countenanced and pleaded for by all the generation of malignant and prophane perſons throughout the Land? And ſure, if it had been ſo much countenanced and owned of God, it is not like that it ſhould have been ſo endeared to theſe who have ſo much oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his friends and intereſt in <hi>Scotland</hi> theſe many years paſt. 4 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> did for no other cauſe, but for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting againſt their wrong Conſtitution, and the ratifying of theſe Reſolutions, cenſure and pronounce the ſentences of Depoſition and Suſpenſion againſt ſundry godly men who have obtained mercy of the Lord to be followers of his Cauſe ſince the begining of the late Reformation, and whoſe Miniſtry hath been ſealed of the Lord up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearts of not a few of his People. 5. Becauſe they did by their Acts lay a foundation for cenſuring all Miniſters, Elders, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectants, Students and Profeſſors whatſoever, who refuſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the conſtitution of that Aſſembly and oppoſe the Acts thereof; which as it makes way for the caſting out of many able &amp; godly Profeſſors from being Church-members (for it is wel known how many there be of the godly in the Land both Miniſters, Elders, and Profeſſors, who cannot be conſenting to ſubmit to theſe things, but do hold themſelves bound in their ſtations to bear teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them) Now, to caſt out &amp; perſecute all theſe, or to lay a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation fordoing of it, whether it be to be owned &amp; guided of God, and to do things to edification; or if it be not rather to be deſerted of the Lord, to eſtabliſh iniquity by a Law, and to decree unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Decrees, &amp; write grievous things againſt their Brethren which they have preſcribed, I leave it to thoſe who are taught of God, to conſider. As to that paſſage in the Warning and Declaration of that Aſſembly (ſo much magnified and cried up by the Author of this <hi>Review</hi>) it was, and it is the intention of the Proteſters, through the Lords aſſiſtance (though with much weakneſs) to oppoſe the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102069:6"/>deſign and work of the Adverſaries on both hands, and to tread the middle path, the good old way, without declining to the right hand or to the left, upon which accompt it was that they could not condeſcend to employ and aſſociat with, and entruſt one adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for oppoſing another, knowing ſuch courſes to be condemned of God in his holy Word, and to have proven bitter often hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto this Nation, and for this cauſe did ſolemnly engage, that we ſhould do no more ſo: Therefore have they alwaies owned, and ſtrictly adhered to the Covenant and Cauſe, and former Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the reforming party in this Land, ſet down in their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Papers; and that they might not partake of other mens ſins, did not concur with, but bear teſtimony againſt the carnal counſels of mens own hearts, becauſe of which the Sword did abide in our Cities, and conſume our branches, and devour them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.6. and the ſpirit that hath been ſtirring in them in theſe actings (I truſt) is no other then the good Spirit of God, the Spirit of truth and holineſs, the voice behind them that ſpeaks in the ears of the Lords People, <hi>This is the way, walk ye in it, when they turn to the right hand, and when they turn to the left hand, Iſa.</hi> 30.21. In order to this paſſage of the Warning at <hi>Dundee,</hi> I wiſh the firſt penner thereof, and the Gentleman who now hath cited it, and all others, to conſider theſe few things: 1. That not long ago there was a time that ſome of the beſt and moſt precious of theſe who now charge the Proteſters with theſe harſh imputations of having <hi>a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſtirring in their work that hath been, and is moſt effectual for carrying on of the deſign of the Adverſaries of our Canſe</hi> were liable no leſs then the Proteſtors now are to the ſame Imputations from theſe by whom they now are cried up and commended, and with whom they now joyn iſſue in caſting them upon their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. It concerns them to think whence theſe changes are, and whether they have given diligent heed to that word of exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſaith, <hi>Let them come to thee, but go not thou to them.</hi> 2. That the Proteſters have ſtudied to take hold of every oportunity to declare and make known their approbation of, and adherence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Work of Reformation, and to bear teſtimony againſt all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done thereunto, and encroachments made thereupon, and have endeavoured to the utmoſt of their power to prevent and remedy the ſame. 3. That the Authors and Abettors of the Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, have now met ſeveral times in their Aſſemblies and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102069:7"/>yet to this day have we had no word of teſtimony from them againſt theſe adverſaries of our Cauſe, with the promoting of whoſe deſign they do ſo much charge the Proteſters, but their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and zeal hath been ſpent another way. As to what they have done at their late Aſſembly with cloſed doors, none being preſent but themſelves, that cannot be looked on as a teſtimony to the Cauſe of Chriſt, and at the beſt it will amount to no higher, then the profeſſion of <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in private. Why have they not made it a teſtimony indeed, and appointed ſome of their number to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, own and avow it, before ſome of theſe againſt whom they te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, as the Proteſters did ſeaſonably and with the firſt oportunity? Or why did they remove all others out of their meeting? Were they afraid that ſome ſhould have born witneſſe and teſtified what they had done? If they looked on themſelves as an Aſſembly of this Kirk, they cannot be ignorant that the tranſactions of Generall Aſſemblies ought and uſe to be publick, and eſpecially their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Or why did they not communicate the ſame to Synods, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Congregations, but let it ly in the dark to this day. If they deſire to be accompted faithfull, they would either give a more diſtinct and certain ſound concerning theſe adverſaries, or elſe ſpeak leſſe againſt the Proteſters, leſt they bewray more paſſion then pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and more of the zeal of themſelves, then of the true zeal of God. 4. Where hath that ſpirit lodged which this laſt year paſt hath been moſt effectuall for carrying on the deſign of the adverſaries, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther among the Proteſters, or amongſt the Authors and Abettors of the Publick Reſolutions, let themſelves ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe he is pleaſed from that Warning and Declaration of the Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> to mention ſeven ſteps of progreſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they labour to prove what they do aſſert in the former paſſage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by him; therefore ſeeing that Declaration (which is fraughted with much ill-grounded charity to Malignants, and with a great deal of cauſeleſſe prejudice and miſtaken zeal againſt many of the precious and godly in the Land) begins again to be digged up out of its grave, wherein ſad diſpenſations of Providence did once ſeem to bury it before it could be heard ſpeak in many of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Land, therefore though he do inſiſt on the laſt Step. yet for truths ſake, and for clearing of theſe who are traduced without cauſe, I ſhall ſpeak ſhortly to all the ſeven.</p>

                     <p>TWo things are charged here upon the Proteſters and their adherents, as the principle of their actings, credulity in ſome, and deſigne in others. As to the firſt, it is indeed ordinary to gracious men to be credulous of theſe who have the ſhew of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, until they ſee them deny the power thereof, and I think this fault (if it be a fault) may be eaſily pardoned by theſe who allow ſo large charity to Malignants upon bare and naked Profeſſions now and then, when they come before the Judicatories of the Kirk, notwithſtanding of their many former breaches and relapſes, and known diſſimulatio, &amp; contrary cariages in the tenor of their ſpeeches &amp; actings but what ever be theſe mens credulity, yet ſeing they walked in the ſimplicity of their hearts, the Lord hath to this day keeped them out of ſnares, and given them, as to the main of their carriage, to keep the ſtraight way, declining extreams on both hands. As to the ſecond, to wit, a crafty deſigne in others, it is alleadged to be apparently ſo, but no evidence is brought of that, neither can any evidence be brought of it, it being a meer alleadge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, without all ground of truth, ſuch things have been ſpoken, and written, and preached by ſome now for a good while paſt, it is now high time ſince it hath been ſo often called for, for their own credits ſake to bring ſome proof of what they ſay; I beſeech the Author if theſe words, and of all ſuch expreſſions, as before the Lord, and as they would not wrong themſelves nor their brethren, nor delude and do injury to others, by filling their hearts with thoughts of jealouſie and rancour againſt innocent men, if they know any thing of this kind, to bring it forth; and if they know
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102069:8"/>nothing to forbear ſuch reproches, which thogh for the preſent they be bitter to theſe whom they aſperſe, yet in the end the ſhame wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn upon the heads of theſe who have broached and vented them; It nay be remembred, that reproaches of this kind were caſt upon the moſt eminent and faithfull, in the year 1648, by the Authors of the unlawfull Engagement, becauſe of their oppoſing thereof, and bearing teſtimony againſt the ſame; but paſsing theſe, I come to that which is alleadged to be their work, and that was, that they did reſiſt and retard the lifting of an Army for defence of the Cauſe and Kingdom, for clearing and confuting of which, it would be remembred, that as in reſolving and condeſcending upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions given to the Commiſsioners of this Kingdom for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the King, there were ſome who too much favouring the Malignant party, would have had it put in Inſtruction, that this Kingdom would engage in a War againſt <hi>England,</hi> for reſtoring the King to his Throne, upon condition of his giving ſatisfaction in the Demands propounded to him, which when they could not obtain, their next endeavour was, that the tranſaction at <hi>Bredah</hi> might be ſo carried, as that the King and his Party might have ſome probable aſſurance of this, and therefore was the firſt invitation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the King there, contrived in ſuch words &amp; expreſsions, as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to import the ſame; which being ſent home to this Kingdom, was cenſured &amp; corrected by the Parl. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> new Inſtructions ſent back to <hi>Holland,</hi> containing the expreſs demands of this Kingdom to the King, and the form of the Invitation given him upon ſatisfaction <hi>in terminis</hi> to theſe demands; which form of Invitation &amp; Declaration made therewith did exclude all engagement to make war upon <hi>England,</hi> yet was there a Party in the Land, and ſome in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whoſe deſignes and endeavors did ſtill tend to engage us in a War againſt <hi>England.</hi> On the other hand there was cauſe to fear an Invaſion from <hi>England,</hi> by reaſon of the preparations made the former year by thoſe in power in that Nation, upon the report of an Agreement betwixt the King and Commiſſioners ſent from this Kingdome to <hi>Holland,</hi> in the year 1649. The great difficulty was, how to ſteer an even courſe in reference to both theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, both to prevent a ſinfull Invaſion from this Land upon <hi>England,</hi> and from <hi>England</hi> upon this Nation. The Parliament having ſeriouſly pondered both the dangers, took this courſe; They ſent to their Commiſſioners then in <hi>Holland,</hi> renewed Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102069:8"/>together with a Declaration, wherein they made known their diſſatisfaction with ſeverall things in the Treaty, in which the Commiſſioners had varied from their Inſtructions, particularly they declared, that nothing agreed on ſhould import an obligation to make War againſt <hi>England,</hi> and gave expreſſe direction that none of the Malignant Party ſhould be permitted to come to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and this Inſtruction was forthwith turned into a Law, and publiſhed in Print by Proclamation at the Market Croſſe of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh:</hi> And the Earl of <hi>Calendar</hi> who had adventured to come from <hi>Holland</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon hopes of the approbation of that Treaty, was preſently commanded to go aboard a ſhip within twenty four hours, and forthwith to depart the Kingdom, under the pain of impriſonment, and the fine of a hundred thouſand merks. Theſe Inſtructions and the Declaration of the Parliament, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Commiſſioners in <hi>Holland,</hi> before the King came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, together alſo with Letters to the ſame purpoſe from the Commiſſion of the Kirk to their Commiſſioners. To prevent the danger of an Invaſion from <hi>England,</hi> the Parliament did (without ſo much as the leaſt queſtion or objection made to the contrary by any Member thereof) renew the Acts of Poſture and Leavie which were made the year preceding, for putting the Kingdom in readineſſe in caſe of Invaſion, and upon the 22. of <hi>June</hi> 1650. they wrote Letters directed to Mr. <hi>Lenthall,</hi> Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> then Lord Generall, Lieut. Generall <hi>Cromwell,</hi> Major Generall <hi>Lambert,</hi> and the Governour of <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> in which Lettes they ſhew, that <hi>as in their Letter of the</hi> 6. <hi>March</hi> 1649. <hi>they did both acknowledge their obligation, and did declare their reſolution to obſerve the rule of remonſtrating firſt the breaches of Peace, of craving juſt reparation, of uſing all fair means of giving a preceding Warning of three moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any engagement of theſe Kingdoms in War, ſo they do again renew the ſame, and do ſolemnly profeſſe, that they do it in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of their hearts, not out of any policy to catch advantages for any other end or deſigne, but meerly for their own defence, which they do accompt abundantly ſufficient to remove all grounds of jealouſies and miſ-reports of their intentions, and to take away all pretence of neceſſity of the marching of Forces for defence of the Borders of</hi> England. <hi>And being informed of a reſolution in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>to ſend an Army to invade this Kingdom, they deſired to know
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102069:9"/>whether theſe who have the preſent power in</hi> England <hi>do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themſelves obliged, or by their anſwer will oblige themſelves and declare their reſolutions to obſerve the foreſaid way and order upon their part to us, and plainly and clearly to declare whether their Forces do march for defence or offence, for keeping onely within the Borders of</hi> England, <hi>or coming within ours: which way of proceaor in clearing each other, and dealing plainly, is not onely agreeable to particular Treaties, and to the many Bonds and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations past betwixt theſe Kingdoms, but alſo to the Law of God, and practice of his people in his Word, and to the Common Law and practice even of Heathen Nations, much more of Chriſtian co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted Kingdomes, &amp;c.</hi> When the Forces appointed to be raiſed for defence of the Kingdom, together with the old ſtanding Forces that were before on foot, were to be formed and drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a Body, there were ſome differences in Parliament; one was, Whether the Malignant Party, and perſons groſſely ſcandalous ſhould be excluded from the Army, or not? There were none in Parliament that had the countenance to plead for it directly; our conſtant Principles being known to be ſo expreſſe againſt it, and the Kirk having ſo often preſſed upon the Parliament by many Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Remonſtrances, and Declarations, the purging of their Forces, but diverſe would have had the Act for making up the Army to paſſe, without appointing any Committee, having power to remove ſuch from the Army Another difference was, Whether the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Eſtates ſhould have power to command the Army to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>England</hi> (as was done in the year 1648) or if there ſhould be a limitation of their power onely to ſtand for the defence of the Land within our Borders. In this queſtion likewiſe there were none that pleaded expreſſely for ſuch a power in the Committee, but they oppoſed the limitation. Some time was ſpent in confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and debate about theſe, but they were ſo few in Parliament that were either againſt the excluſion or limitation, that when the ſenſe of the Parliament came to be known, their number was no wayes conſiderable, ſo that what is here repreſented by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of that Declaration againſt the Proteſters, as the firſt ſtep of declining, is in effect an evidence of their own declining from the former principles of State and Kirk, for both were then unanimous for excluſion of the Malignant Party and groſſely ſcandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from the Army, and againſt the invading of <hi>England,</hi> which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102069:9"/>were the two queſtions in Parliament that did retard for ſome days the bringing forth the new levied Forces; for ſo ſoon as theſe two queſtions were ended, it was evidently ſeen there were none more forward in Parliament and Committees to haſten them to the fields, then theſe who are unſatisfied with the late <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I Confeſſe it is to me matter of ſorrow and aſtoniſhment to hear theſe words. Was not the purging of the Army from ſuch of the Engagers as had not approven themſelves in their repentance, a duty that all of us were ſolemnly engaged unto before the Lord? Had not the Generall Aſſemblies of this Kirk, and their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before that time, given in above twenty ſeverall Petitions, War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Remonſtrances to the Parliament and Committee of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates for that end?

And I do as much wonder of that which they ſpeak of the Kings Intereſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing was done in reference thereto, but the declaring of the due ſubordination thereof unto God's, and that they would not otherwiſe owne him and his quarrell, but in that ſubordination, and that they meaned to fight upon the ſame ſtate of quarrell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they had done theſe twelve years paſt, which was not done by any particular perſons or party, but jointly and unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both by the Committee of Eſtates, and Commiſſion of the Kirk, none diſſenting, and was homologated by the whole Officers of the Army in a ſupplication to the Committee of Eſtates, and ſo far as did then appear, generally followed in their ſtations and capacity. This, together with the leaving that Declaration of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Kirk, anent the ſubordination of the Kings Intereſt, out of the Act of the Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> which ratifieth the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Commiſſion, ſpeaks what ſpirit ſtirred in the Aſſembly when theſe things were penned and approven; but (ſay they) under pretence of theſe things, courſes were taken fordividing of the Army, and yet they do not tell what theſe courſes were at that time, but labour to find the evidence of them in after actings, they did wiſely to wrap up in generals, without condeſcending upon any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, leſt they ſhould have therein been found out, but their generals are as eaſily denied, as affirmed. What is meaned by after-actings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth

I ſhall wonder at his wit, to ſay nothing of his conſcience. Who theſe faithfull ones to God and the King are, whoſe ſpirits they did ſo much labour to perplex and diſcourage, I do not know. I do as little know what were theſe untimous and dangerous motions, wherein ſuch as were under ſuſpition of too much affection to the Enemy, were humoured in, and yeelded unto. It may be remembred that as a great part of the Army was much weighted in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, with the carriage of theſe, eſpecially ſome of chief note, who did obſtruct the purging of the Army, and gave countenance and encouragement to ſuch as were, or ſhould have been removed out of the Army; ſo the whole Army Officers and Souldiers, and the Committee of Eſtates were much perplexed, diſcouraged, and diſ-ſatisfied with the ſlackneſs, ſhiftings, and delayes, and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary counſels and courſes of chief men in the Army, who had the leading of the Forces, and for moſt part did do therein, and diſpoſe therof as ſeemed beſt to themſelves, without taking much notice ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Committee of Eſtates or Officers of the Army; and none was more perplexed, diſcouraged, and diſ-ſatisfied with this way, then ſome of theſe who had a chief hand in penning this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in ſo much that having once ſpoken therein, they got ſo unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying an anſwer, that with much diſcontent they did declare, they meaned never to ſpeak again in that matter. And it may be alſo remembred, that the untimous and dangerous motions of which they ſpeak, were ſo far from being thought ſo when they were proponed, that it was the grief of many in the Army &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Eſtates, yea and of Aſſembly-men too, who are ſuppoſed to be skilled in theſe things, that they were not entertained and hearkened unto, the truth is, never any motion of that kind made by any of theſe whom they call of ſuſpected affection, from the day that our Army came together, untill the day that it was routed, was hearkened unto, unleſſe they inſtance the in-fall at <hi>Muſste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> but onely the half of that motion was followed for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which was appointed by the unanimous reſolution of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to make good their retreat, who made the in-fall, was not ſent, which, whether it was faithfulneſſe to God and the King, and to their Brethren, much of whoſe blood was ſhed, their own hearts who did it can beſt judge, as beſt knowing what were the induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

I truſt they will not deny that this was a dangerous motion, and they cannot ſay, that any of theſe ſuſpected men had a hand therein. Concerning the laſt words of that ſecond ſtep, let it be this day examined and conſidered, what hath been the carriage of theſe ſuſpected men, and of their unſuſpected men the Malignant Party, and it will at leaſt be found very evident, that this Reviewer his ſuſpition is calculated to a wrong Meridian.</p>

They would do a great favour to the whole Land, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to ſimple ones, if they would be pleaſed once to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend by name and ſurname, upon the ſubtile enſnaring men that do abuſe others, that they might be known and avoided. For theſe who were at the compiling of that Remonſtrance, I know many of them to be men of great and good parts, but I know none of them that are very skilfull in drawing circles in the dark, and conjuring other men unawares within the compaſſe thereof; they are open
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102069:12"/>ingenuous men, whoſe hearts and deſignes have alwayes been read in their profeſſions and expreſſions, and theſe whom they call the abuſed and enſnared ones, are more intelligent and diſcerning men, then to be eaſily deceived; they are many of them eminent for grace and abilities, and ſuch as have approved themſelves in ſpecial truſts and employments relating to the Cauſe and Kingdome. It is true that ſince the preſenting of that Remonſtrance, ſome of them did ſlip in a day of temptation, by paſsing from the ſame; but it is as true, that it is the matter of their humiliation for which they mourn before God, and ſome of them ſo much, that hardly can they be comforted. It is to me a great confirmation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, that it was approved and accepted by the Lord as a neceſſary duty, that gracious men, who by the tentations of the time, and the perſwaſions of ſome whoſe judgements they reſpected, being drawn into a ſnare at <hi>Sterline</hi> to diſclaim the Remonſtrance, they were within very few dayes after, ſo challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in conſcience, that they had no peace of mind till they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged their fault, and reſolved to walk ſoftly all their years in the bitterneſſe of ſoul. The firſt thing that they challenge in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance is, That the owning of the Kings juſt Intereſt, agreed unto by the Generall Aſſembly and the Parliament, was expreſſely laid aſide, and his removall from the exerciſe of his Royall Power and Government adviſed to the Committee of Eſtates; but in this they do not deal fairly, not onely becauſe they leave out the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon which this is offered to be conſidered by the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, which are very weighty and important; but alſo becauſe they omit to tell, that the Gentlemen, Miniſters, and Forces of the Weſt, had no other meaning in the Remonſtrance as to the Kings Intereſt, then what was expreſſed in the Declaration at the Weſt Kirk of the 12. <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the year 1650. In which the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Eſtates, the Commiſsion of the Kirk, and the Army, did unanimouſly joyn in their ſeverall ſtations and capacities; in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony whereof they were willing, and did often offer accordingly to clear and explain the ſame, if ſo be the Commiſsion ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to give any ſenſe upon it, and let un-byaſſed men judge if it was unſeaſonable to remonſtrate this, upon the Kings deſerting the Councels of State and Kirk, and joyning with the Malignant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, contrary to the Covenant and Treaty. The next thing chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102069:13"/>is, That the authority of the Committee of Eſtates is thereby weakened; but it is not told how, belike it is meaned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the freedom that is therein uſed, in laying before them the ſins and miſ-carriages of ſundry of theſe who were then in place and power, but the diſcovering and taking with of ſin, doth not weaken but ſtrengthen authority; that which hath provoked the Lord to daſh our Judicatories in pieces, and to bring them to nothing, is, Becauſe they have refuſed to take with their guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to <hi>humble themſelves under the mighty hand of God.</hi> If the freedome that was uſed in the Remonſtrance, in reference to Members of the Committee of Eſtates offend any, theſe four things would be remembred: 1. That what is therein repreſented, is known and undeniable truth. 2. That the Lord was calling thereto by his moſt dreadful ſtroaks. 3.

That the men who ſpoke, were about to lay down their lives, and therefore took liberty to ſpeak all their hearts, that they might exoner themſelves, and leave it as their teſtimony with others. The third is, that a way of holding up a conſtant diviſion from State and Kirk is therein moulded, but nothing is ſaid to make out this; and though ſome of the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators be judged and called ſubtile and deſigning men. yet as they did intend no ſuch thing, ſo do I doubt exceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>LEt it be conſidered what theſe conditions were which the Church and State could neither in honour nor conſcience grant. As for the Kings exerciſing of his power, the Remonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors did declare, that they had in humility propounded their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the reaſons thereof unto the Committee of Eſtates; but it was in their power to hearken unto them, and to do ſo, yea or no, as they thought fit, and that if they ſhould not be pleaſed, ſtill to debar the King from the exerciſe of his power, as he had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, they would not refuſe to live peaceably under him, as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat of the Land, only two things they did deſire in order to their uniting with the Forces of the Kingdom: 1. That the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell upon which they fought, might be ſtated as in the Declaration of the 13. of <hi>Aug.</hi> 1650. 2. That there might be one to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Forces, qualified according to the ſolemn Engagement unto duties, to wit, of a blameleſs and Chriſtian converſation, and of known integrity and conſtant affection to the Cauſe of God; both which conditions were refuſed. Now, I would fain know a reaſon why theſe things might not be condeſcended unto in honor and conſcience. Was it leſſe honour or conſcience to ſtate the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel in <hi>November</hi> 1650. according to the foreſaid Declaration, then it-was to ſtate it in <hi>Auguſt.</hi> immediatly preceding? Had any thing occurred in order to the King for altering the ſtate of the quarrell, and making it more favourable as to him, or rather, was there not ſomething to the contrary, to wit, his deſerting of the Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, giving of Commiſsions to the Malignants, and joyning with them? Or was it contrary to honour and conſcience to ſatisfie them in the other? Or did not both honour and conſcience binde them to it? As to the imploying of the Malignant Party, there is ſo much ſaid in a particular Treatiſe to demonſtrate the ſinfulneſs of it, as alſo that there was no neceſsity for it, that I ſhall not now inſiſt upon it, only I deſire that to be taken notice of, which they ſay of making uſe of ſuch as had been formerly received to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102069:14"/>for their ſinfull courſes, and admitting others to repentance from whom ſatisfaction might be gotten, agreeable to the Rules of the Generall Aſſembly, that all together might be imployed. Which words import, that as they did require repentance in all theſe who were formerly excluded, and were now to be imployed; ſo alſo that care was taken to receive none but ſuch as ſatisfied according to the Rules of the Generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, both which are ſpoken <hi>gratis,</hi> and without ground. The firſt, becauſe in anſwer to the <hi>Quere,</hi> and in the Warning penned for the ſtrengthening of it (which two were the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of imploying theſe men) there is no word of repentance, or ſatisfaction as neceſſary requiſites in theſe who were to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the defence of the Kingdom, and of the Cauſe, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions in the Anſwer exclude onely excommunicated perſons forefaulted, notoriouſly profane, or flagitious, and ſuch as have been from the beginning, and continue ſtill, or are at this time obſtinate and profeſſed enemies and oppoſers of the Covenant and Cauſe of GOD; and moſt, if not all the Arguments in the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning run for imploying all men who are Subjects without any ſuch qualification. The laſt becauſe the order preſcribed by the Gen. Aſſembly was not keeped in receiving of them: That Order (as is evident from the Act of the Aſſembly 49. concerning the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Engagers) is, <q>That becauſe many heretofore have made ſhew and profeſſion of their Repentance, who were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their guiltineſſe, nor humbled for the ſame, but did thereafter return with the dog to the vomite, and with the ſow to the puddle, unto the mocking of GOD, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great reproach and detriment of his Cauſe: Therefore for the better determining the truth &amp; ſincerity of the repentance of thoſe who deſire to be admitted to the Covenant and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, It is appointed &amp; ordained, that none of thoſe perſons who are debarred from the Covenant and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion ſhal be admitted and received thereto, but ſuch as after exact tryal ſhall be found for ſome competent time, before or after the offer of their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, according to the diſcretion of the reſpective Judicatories, to have in their ordinary converſations given reall teſtimony of their diſlike of the late unlawful Engagement, and of the courſes and wayes of Malignants, and of their ſorrow for their acceſſion to the ſame, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly; and if any

                     <p>Now let Conſciences ſpeak, whether this order in receiving theſe men was obſerved yea, or not; yea, it was ſo far from it, that they were received without ſuch evidences in a very raſh and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant way, unto the moſt manifeſt mocking of Repentance that hath been heard or ſeen in any Church in the world, many of them flouting and jeering at the Judicatories of the Kirk, and one at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and making ſports of their Confeſſions amongſt their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and giving as much evidence of their malignancy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanity and hating of godlineſs in their ſpeeches and carriage as of before: Did not the Commiſſion make ſuch haſt to receive theſe who had broken out in Rebellion, and riſen in Arms againſt the Cauſe and Kingdom after <hi>Dumbar,</hi> that notwithſtanding they had once by an Act remitted them all for cenſure to the Gen. Aſſembly, and intimated the ſame to Presbyteries, that they might not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the renewing of the Covenant or Communion, till the Aſſembly ſhould judge of their caſe; yet they did after the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Quere make a new Act for receiving them, to the great offence of the godly, and expoſing of their own Authority to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and reproach.</p>

Albeit it is here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted that ſome men did by all means poſſible oppoſe the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Army, according to the Publick Reſolutions, and that they left no means uneſſayed to make theſe Reſolutions ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for raiſing of the Army, yet they muſt be the men who thus oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the making up of the Army as it was: How this ſhould be I do not well know, unleſs it was by an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> as heat ſometimes occaſions cold, and cold, heat; or, as the preaching of the Goſpel occaſions war upon the earth. It is like enough that the Teſtimony which was born againſt that way did inſtate mens corruptions and make them more violent and head-ſtrong in the proſecution of the ſame. But their meaning happily is, That theſe men did oppoſe the union of the Forces, or would not ſuffer others to riſe for the defence of the Kingdom and Cauſe, and ſo put the Committee of Eſtates upon a neceſſity of employing of theſe. To joyning of the Forces we have ſpoke before, and ſhewed upon what terms they were willing to have joyned, and that there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came to them any Order or Command from the State for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, and for the other, until there was ſtumbling-blocks put in their way by the Publick Reſolutions; they were ſo far from hindring any, againſt whom there was not juſt exception, that they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102069:15"/>were willing to employ themſelves to the utmoſt in defence of the Cauſe and Kingdom, and gave abundant proof thereof from the time they firſt took up Arms until the month of <hi>December,</hi> that the Lord was pleaſed in his wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

May not, yea, ought not the ſervants of God, Miniſters and People bear te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony againſt declining and backſliding, and ſtudy to keep their own garments pure, and refuſe to ſay a confederacy to wicked men in the Intereſts and Cauſe of God. It is a ſhrewd inſinuation that is made of their drawing factions amongſt the People, as if they had ſtirred the People to ſedition, or to tumults: The ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt length which Miniſters went, was to hold forth the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that courſe, how contrary it was to our former Principles, how it would help to haſten on more wrath; or if it did ſeem to proſper, how dangerous it would prove to the Cauſe and People of God by ſetting up of ſuch as had been, and ſtill were adverſaries to both, and the greateſt length which People went, was, To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their diſlike thereof, and without tumult or faction to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, or in a ſober and modeſt way to refuſe to concur, becauſe they had no clearneſs nor ſatisfaction in their conſciences concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Reſolutions; withal, they did clearly declare their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt the Invaſion, and for the defence of the Cauſe and their Country, and their readineſs to concur in all lawful means, according to the Word and former Principles for that end. If any who had been formerly honeſt, and born any part of the burden and heat of the day, were branded as back-ſliders, it was not ſo much by Diſſenters from the Publick Reſolutions, as by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of that generation with whom they did aſſociat, I mean the Malignants who did not ſpare openly and every where to ſay. That
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102069:16"/>theſe honeſt men were now come to them; as for others, though they cannot ſo vindicate themſelves as to ſay that there is none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them who doth at any time ſpeak raſhly or unadviſedly with his lips, yet the Lord knows it was the grief of their hearts that honeſt men ſhould have fallen from their integrity; and though they could not chuſe but bear Teſtimony againſt their ſin, yet they did it as afflicted in ſpirit, keeping reverence, reſpect, and affection unto the men themſelves, and had the iniquity been pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, they would moſt willingly have covered the ſhame thereof, but it was publick and ſuch as did relate to the publick Cauſe, and wherein their con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102069:16"/>no poſſible nor probable mean was holden forth by theſe who did object againſt them, it was to no purpoſe then to do it, the Authors and Abetters of them being ſo zealous for them that they would admit of no obiection to the contrary, much leſs be content to wave theſe Reſolutions, and go to a calm and peaceable enquiry about other poſſible or probable means of defence; and yet, as before the taking of theſe Reſolutions, the poſſibility and probability of other means had been often holden forth, ſo was it alſo holden forth after the taking of theſe Reſolutions. To ſay nothing of Treaty and Conference (which was moved by ſome, but peremptorily and bitterly rejected by others) the poſſibility and probability of getting an Army, without employing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting of the Malignant party, was holden forth, and they who did aſſert otherwiſe, did a great deal of wrong to the Kingdom and Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and make them too much malignant.

In the year 1649. there was great concord betwixt Kirk and State, both adhering to their Principles, and the Lord wonderfully bleſſed their Councels and Forces; as alſo in the begining of the year 1650. And whatever ſecret under-hand dealings there were for the promoting the Malignant Intereſt and Conjunction with that party, yet it was little known to the far greater part in Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of State and Kirk, who (I am confident) went on in the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of their hearts in their proceedings, ſtudiouſly deſirous to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the ſplitting on the rock of Malignancy, aſwel as the rock on the other hand.</p>
                     <p>The firſt viſible ſtep of deelining that was taken notice of by the generality of zealous Profeſſors in the Land, was that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action made at <hi>Bredah</hi> with the King, by the Commiſſioners of State and Kirk, expreſſely contrary to their Inſtructions: and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding both State and Kirk did unanimouſly ſignifie their great diſ-ſatisfaction therewith, and declared againſt the ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y particulars, eſpecially in reference to Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Intereſts and deſignes, and conjunction with that Party; all which was made known to the ſaid Commiſſioners by Letters and Declarations from State and Kirk, which were delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them before the Kings coming from <hi>Holland,</hi> yet without ſo much as acquainting the King therewith, they brought him on ſhipboard, and alongs with him, the chief of the Scottiſh and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102069:22"/>Malignants, known enemies to the Cauſe and Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. (I do not charge all the Commiſſioners as equally ſharers in the guilt of that ſad tranſaction, for which the Land ſuff reth and lamenteth to this day, I know that ſuch of them as had leaſt hand therein, have been moſt ready to acknowledge their offence; and that theſe who were moſt guilty, do ſtand for their own juſtification, which aggravates their ſin both before God and men) as to that which was done afterward, ſad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath taught us, that it was but a pitifull after-game they made in their ſecond Treaty, while the King was at Sea, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly before his landing in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and it was ſo far from being a remedie, as it hath proved an in-let to further tranſgreſſion and miſery.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſtep of defection was, That theſe Commiſſioners when they were come home, being deſirous to maintain their own credit, dealt not faithfully in giving a true accompt of their proceedings to the Parliament and Generall Aſſembly, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed many things of conſequence, and ſmoothed and varn ſhed their report of Proceedings with fair generalls, whereby both the Parliament and Generall Aſſembly were deceived, and induced to allow and ratifie their Proceedings.</p>
                     <p>The third ſtep was, That when after <hi>Dumbar,</hi> the King had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Commiſſion to the Malignant Party to riſe in Arms, and upon their riſing had deſerted the Councels of State and Kirk, and gone away to joyn with that Party, the State did ſond for the King, and forthwith admit him to have the chief hand and Government in all their Councels and managing of Affairs, from which upon weighty conſiderarions he had been ſtill debarred formerly by the State, upon advice with the Kirk, and not many dayes after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, matters were ſo conveyed, as an agreement was made with theſe wicked and bloudy re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ells; and not onely their preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and band into which they had entered among themſelves, but all their former tranſgreſſions were paſſed over by the State, and in that tranſaction alſo, there was a foundation laid for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of them in places of truſt. It is true, that the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Church gave ſome teſtimony againſt theſe proceedings, the conſciences of diverſe of that Meeting being then oftended with ſo groſſe declining, but afterward through the great
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102069:22"/>oppoſition they met with, were much blunted.</p>
                     <p>The fourth ſtep was, That as the Kirk and State began to grow in their favour and reſpects towards the Malignant Party, this new friendſhip begat an alienation of their hearts from honeſt and faithfull men who gave teſtimony againſt theſe corruptions; for uſually conjunction with Gods enemies is attended with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of his friends; and therefore the Weſtern Forces being diſſipated, and great hopes conceived of the aſſiſtance of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Party, both State and Kirk did condemne the Teſtimony given by the Gentlemen, Officers, and Miniſters in the Weſt, in their Remonſtrance to the Committee of Eſtates; notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in a Meeting of the Commiſſion of the Kirk at <hi>Sterline,</hi> that Remonſtrance was cleared and vindicated, and all objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt it were ſo fully anſwered by Members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as the chief oppofites thereof, had no more to ſay againſt it, but were ſilent; notwithſtanding alſo that ſome of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men gave in a Supplication to the Commiſſion, wherein they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that before any cenſures paſted thereupon, theſe that were concerned therein might be allowed a due hearing, and that a convenient diet might be appointed, at which they were very hopefull to remove all miſtakes, and clear it from all ſiniſter inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations.</p>
                     <p>The fifth ſtep was, That ſome leading men of the Commiſſion did conveen ex raordinarily a ſmall number of the Commiſſion of the Kirk, few above a <hi>Quorum,</hi> to make an anſwer to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>Quaere, viz.</hi> What perſons ought to be imployed in Arms for defence of the Kingdom, and ſlighted ſending of timeous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement to ſuch as they knew would oppoſe their deſigne of bringing in the Malignant Party, to be Guardians of the Cauſe and Kingdom, which formerly they had endeavoured to deſtroy, and with great haſte and precipitation, concluded an anſwer to that <hi>Quaere,</hi> and laid a foundation for preſent conjunction with the Malignant Party, contrary to the Word of God, and to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and to our known principles clearly expreſſed in Acts and Declarations of this Kirk.</p>
                     <p>They did not reſt here, but in the ſixth place they put forth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations and Watnings, wherein they threatned all theſe who are unſatisfied with, or do oppoſe the Publick Reſolutions with
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102069:23"/>puniſhments and cenſures to be inflicted by Judicatories, Civill and Eccleſiaſtick, reſpectively; Yea, they proceed further, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply againſt ſuch the Characters of Malignants, and to ſtir up the Civill Magiſtrate againſt them, and Presbyteries to cenſure them, and the Act which the Commiſſion had made for referring the Malignants that had riſen in Arms, to the next Generall Aſſembly: and in the mean while ſuſpending them from the Sacrament, was by themſelves revoked, and in their ſtead faithfull Miniſters of unqueſtioned integrity, who were unſatisfied in conſcience with ſuch Malignant proceedings, were appointed to be cited to the Aſſembly.</p>
                     <p>Neither was all this enough, but in the ſeventh place there muſt be yet a nearer and full conjunction with the Malignant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they were already advanced to chief places of truſt in the Army; but the Acts of Claſſes made againſt <hi>James Grahame</hi> late Earl of <hi>Moniroſe</hi> his bloody Complices and Aſſociats, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed and broken, and the Malignant Party advanced to the chief places of truſt in the Land, Civill as well as Military; and in effect, to have the whole ſway in Court, Parliament and Army. In this both Kirk and State did concurre. It is true, that the Commiſſion of the Kirk did in that tranſaction, require a Band of Lawborrows to be taken of the Malignants before their admiſſion to ſit in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, obliging them not to endeavour the repealing former Acts made for Religion, and that they ſhould not revenge themſelves upon any for oppoſing or cenſuring them for their Malignant courſes; but all the former Bands given by them for keeping the peace, were diſcharged, and all the penaities of them; and now all the certification and pain required in caſe they ſhould fail, was, that they ſhould be declared Malignants, and loſe their places; a pretty fancie indeed to declare them Malignants. And who ſhould declare it? The Act of Parliament ſaith, It muſt be firſt found by the Parliament, Committees of Eſtates, or Kings Privy Councell, that they have contraveened this Band, and the far greateſt part of them were known Malignants in all their wayes. No ſooner was the Malignant Party admitted to Parliament, but forthwith all who would not concur for promoting the Publick Reſolutions, were declared Enemies, their perſons ordained to be impriſoned, and their eſtates confiſcated, and in this they anſwered the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102069:23"/>of the Commiſſion of the Kirk, publiſhed in their Warning <hi>March</hi> 1651. wherein they foretold, that <hi>no doubt civil puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be inflicted by the Civil Magiſtrate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The eight ſtep was, That the Commiſſion of the Kirk, a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Judicatorie, limited in their proceedings to the Acts of former Generall Aſſemblies, did take upon them to prelimit the elections of the enſuing Generall Aſſembly, by laying a foundation for debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all ſuch as had oppoſed their Reſolutions (which the Author of the Vindication ſo much cryed up in this Pamphlet grants to be <hi>contraverſi juris,</hi> and that they have not for their warrant the preſident and practice of any former Aſſembly) and for conſtituting the Aſſembly of men that were of their judgment, and had practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed theſe Novations by them introduced, which is a preparative of ſo dangerous conſequence, that being admitted, we cannot expect hereafter right conſtituted Aſſemblies, nor look that the purity and power of Religion ſhall be long continued among us; but the ſubordinat Judicatory being permitted in the Intervall betwixt Aſſemblies, to make rules for conſtituting the en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uing Generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, we may ere long be led back to Prelacy and Popery.</p>
                     <p>The ninth ſtep is, That election of Commiſſioners being made generally in Presbyteries according to theſe prelimitations, and they being met at St. <hi>Andrews;</hi> did refuſe the peaceable Overture made to them by theſe brethren who were unſatisfied with the Publick Reſolutions, did admit perſons under ſcandall, to ſit as Judges, after exception made publickly againſt them; yea, did admit them to be both Judges and Party, and did according to the deſigned prelimita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, exclude faithfull and godly men, for their oppoſition to the Publick Reſolutions; all which and much more is fully cleared in the Review of the Vindication of that Aſſembly.</p>
                     <p>The tenth ſtep is, That the ſaid pretended Aſſembly thus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly conſtituted, did ratifie and approve all the Publick Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cenſure godly and faithfull Miniſters for their witneſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe corruptions, and enact againſt the generality of zealous Profeſſors within the Land, that all who did oppoſe, or after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference did not acquieſce in their determinations, ſhould be procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt with the cenſures of the Kirk, and the Commiſſion of that Aſſembly met at <hi>Forfar</hi> 22 <hi>Auguſt,</hi> did in their printed War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, denounce <hi>the heavy curſe of God</hi> againſt all that did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102069:24"/>in their Publick Reſolutions, and appoint the ſame to be read in all Congregations on the Lords day, which if well conſidered, I ſuppoſe may be a parallel to the tyranny and uſurpation of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, and in ſome reſpects above the ſame; for they did not injoyn the practice of the five Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> under pain of cenſures and curſes for diverſe years after they were concluded in that preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Aſſembly.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now proceed in anſwering this Reviewer, who hath col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the ſumme of the Obſervations made in their Aſſembly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their reading of the Proteſtation, and hath borrowed ſome things from the Author of the Vindication. Beſide theſe, I finde nothing in him but frothy words and reproaches. He ſaith, he <hi>will paſſe the Repreſentation, and alſo wave the Propoſitions, becauſe ſatisfactorily anſwered by the Aſsembly:</hi> wherein he is greatly miſtaken, for diverſe of them are not anſwered at all, and others of them only with equivocations, for which let this one inſtance ſerve for the preſent, to wit, becauſe we conceive their late proceedings relating to the Publick Reſolutions, have obſtructed and ſhaken the Work of Reformation, we deſired that they would give aſſurance that they approve of the Acts of uncontraverted Aſſemblies, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning receiving of Penitents. In their anſwer they leave out the word <hi>uncontraverted,</hi> and ſo include their late Aſſemblies Acts, which are the things we complain of. As for the Repreſentation, he ſhould have conſidered what himſelf ſaith in that ſame page, that in ſome caſes a Proteſtation is lawfull; how can he then judge this Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation unlawfull, which is grounded upon the refuſall of the juſt deſires made in that Repreſentation without conſidering the ſame, but he may not ſtay, therefore he makes long ſteps that he may come ſoon at the Proteſtation, his words are theſe, <hi>I ſhal God willing grapple with them in their arſenall of the Proteſtation it ſelf; yet ſhrrtly glanceing onely at ſome principall things,</hi>

Is it not as lawfull, and more neceſſary to Proteſt againſt à wrong Authoritie or uſurpation as againſt wrong act of a true Authority?

The Declaration of the Aſſembly 1647 ſaith, that next to the changing of Principles, the changing of parties, the aſſiſting of theſe whom we ſhould ſuppreſſe, and perſecuting theſe whom we ſhould aſſiſt; the joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with theſe againſt whom the Covenant was made, and againſt theſe for whom it was made, is the great breach of Coveuant, and ſeparation from the Covenanted union which is held forth in the words of the Covenant, obliging us not to be divided and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from that bleſſed Union and conjunction by making de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

It is Declared by the Aſſembly that year, a Principle of our Cauſe, and neceſſary for ſecurity of Religion, that the Malignant Party be eſteemed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Cauſe of GOD, and that aſſociation with them is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Word of GOD, and to the Covenant; ſo doth the Aſſembly 1649 in the Act againſt Engagers. Now I ſay, that theſe who are for the Publick Reſolutions have changed ſome of their Principles, and alſo changed their party, for they have joyned with the Malignant party, and acts and cenſures for perſecuting theſe with whom they were joyned before; where then lyes the guilt of Diviſion? and who made the firſt-ſteps to ſeparation? <hi>à Dee foedere &amp; Ecclefia priſtina Scoticana;</hi> with whomſoever theſe things are found, let them be accounted ſeparatiſts indeed. As for hearing them, and conferting with them in an extra judiciall way, the Proteſters have never declined it; but the hearing which they require, is to be acknowledged as the lawfull Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of this Kirk, and to be obeyed accordingly; and the Review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er intimateth, that there is <hi>a neceſſity of holding the Proteſters as Heathens and Publicans, but that they have found out away of their own to prevent it.</hi> An hard ſentence indeed to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them all: What Exclamations of rigour had there been if ſuch an expreſſion had dropped from the Pen of a Proteſter?

                     <p>He is much miſtaken when he ſaith, a Proteſtation is in its nature odious, and it argueth ſmall knowledge of the ſtate of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> in former times, to ſay it is worſe in this Kirk then elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; It is the mean which the Lord hath bleſſed in the hands of our Fathers, and our own to preſerve the Cauſe of God, and his Kirk in times of Defection, as the Paper ſent by the Clerk of the Aſſembly, and Procurator for the Kirk to their Meeting at St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> doth ſufficiently manifeſt. I deſire this Reviewer may be pleaſed, to take a look of the Narrative of the ſolemn League and Covenant, and Nationall Covenant, where he will find Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reckoned as a mean for preſervation of Religion, and ſo Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation is no diviſive way, but a lawfull endeavour to which we are tyed by Covenant; and in the 6.

He ſaith moſt of the Proteſters are but of Yeſterday; he might have ſaid as much of all men, and ſpoken truly, but if he plead earneſtly for age upon his ſide, I do yeeld him this much, that many of theſe who are for the Publick Reſolutions are of that age that they entered into the Miniſtery in the time of the Prelates, and did ſwear conformity unto the Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> and implicite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience

Thus it was: They meeting then in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> without Order, after a little pauſe, did conſtitute themſelves in to an Eccleſiaſticall Judicatory, wherein Mageſterially they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined things ſo prejuaicial to us, as not onely obſtructed all peace but alſo ſounded the alarm to a new conflict, by emitting a Paper wherein they peremptorily conclude, among the chief cauſes of Gods contraverſy with the land, the Publick Reſolutions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Aſſem. to have a ſpeciall place: And having thus faſt lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the door of peace to mock the world, if it did nought elſe, they ſent ſome of their number to St. <hi>Andrews</hi> to eſſay if they could draw off <hi>3</hi> or <hi>4</hi> there, &amp; others to <hi>Glaſgow</hi> for the like intent, making ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt (which ſome of them ſpared not to profeſs) that if they could get five or ſix of our moſt eminent men off, they cared not for thereſt of the Miniſtery, profeſſing alſo at that conference, and others of them in an open Synod, that they would never unite with the moſt part of the Miniſtery of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſuitable to theſe ends was their carriage at <hi>St Andrews,</hi> as is clear in the Relation of the Paper thereanent, which Paper though Publick enough, we have never yet heard contradicted by any.</p>

                     <p>That which he calleth a Meeting at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> was a Meeting of the Commiſſioners of the Generall Aſſembly 1650. and as great a number of them as was of theſe who (ſlighting the advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others that were joyned with them in Commiſſion) did anſwer the Parliaments <hi>Quere,</hi> and laid the foundation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Malignant Party, beſide there were at this Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many other Godly Miniſters, and Profeſſors from ſeveral parts in the Country conveened, to ſearch, conſider, and after Prayer and Conference to agree on the Cauſes of the Lords controverſy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Land; and being convinced in their judgements that the treaty with the King in <hi>Holland,</hi> the Publick Reſolutions; &amp; corrupt Conſſitution and proceedings of the Aſſembly at <hi>St. Andrews</hi> and <hi>Dundee</hi> were amongſt the parts of the Lands defection, and Cauſes of Gods wrath, they did in conſcience of their duety acknowledge the ſame and their own acceſſion to theſe tranſgreſſions, and ſome did confeſſe with grief, that they had been chief in the treſpaſs; the grounds and reaſons of their conviction are expreſſed in that Paper by him mentioned, which this Reviewer might have refuted, if he had been able, or otherwiſe quarrelled leſſe with it; he doth wrong himſelf as well as the Proteſters, when he ſaith, that they magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially defined things, and peremptorily concluded them: for the title of the Paper ſheweth, that they onely do ſoberly propound things to others, as their advice. He would make this a locking of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102069:28"/>the door of peace, but conſiders not how that long before this, thoſe that are for the Publick Reſolutions, had contrary to the Word of God and Acts of this Kirk, conſtitute themſelves into an Aſsembly, approven the publick Reſolutions, condemned the Remonſtrance and Proteſtation, cenſured ſome with depoſition, and made ſevere Acts againſt all that differed from their way; that was not only to lock the door, but faſten it with bolts and barrs. Then he makes his own conſtruction of the Proteſters, ſending ſome of their number to St. <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and affirms the end to be onely to gain five or ſix of their number, and to make it ſeem true which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth, he ſetteth down two ſpeeches uttered by ſome of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſters; but ſo far as I have learned, there was no ſuch language as he expreſseth. The Proteſters do upon no occaſion deny, that they make a difference betwixt ſome, who in former times have been faithfull, but of late were engaged for the publick reſolutions, through the ſtraits of the time and ſtrong tentations, and betwixt others that have alwayes been promoters of a Malignant Intereſt; they do likewiſe deſervedly eſteem more of ſome leading men of the firſt ſort, then of others of them, and their deſire and endeavor to draw off ſome chief leading men, was to make way to draw off others, of whom alſo they do well eſteem; yet as is to be feared, were too much ſwayed by example of theſe whom they know to have more learning and piety then themſelves: and if a judgment may be given of the thoughts of the hearts of many of the laſt ſort, who maintain the publick reſolutions, from their ſpeeches and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are as deſirous to be rid of theſe chief leading men from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, as the Proteſters are deſirous to receive them. For that Paper anent the Conference at S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> which he ſaith, is publick enough, but not contradicted by any; It is the firſt time for ought I know, that any of the Proteſters have heard of it, and untill it be in more hands then theſe of his judgment, it may meet with no contradiction, and yet well deſerve it.</p>

Neither was there any need of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to oblige others who intruſted them, for their power was limited, and they are not warranted to depart from-one <hi>iota</hi> of the Publick Reſolutions; ſo in that caſe they could not oblige: Nor is he able to make it appear, that it had been a betraying of their truſt to conferre with theſe who refuſe to acknowledge their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, otherwiſe he ſhall condemne the practice of their late Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> for though they would not conferre untill they had conſtituted themſelves into an Aſſembly; yet then they conferred; but the capacity he ſpeaks of, was not acknowledged, but Proteſted againſt, I know that there be ſuch queſtions amongſt States, to ſtick upon the niceties and punctilioes of their Titles, and the acknowledgement of their power; but theſe are too ſtately things; for Miniſters of the Goſpel, it is more ſuitable to uſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian condeſcendence, then to be puffed up with the pomp of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or reall authority, and therefore as I ſee not the ſtrength of this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> ſo I ſee no reaſon why their late Aſſembly at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> refuſed to read a Letter from the Proteſters, becauſe they wanted their Titles indorſed on the back of the Letter. As to the relation he maketh in this Paragraphe, it is greatly perverted. If his ordinary diſcourſe be ſuitable to the language of this Pamphlet, it would give ground enough to adjudge him to have loſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his franke law, and never to be admitted to be a witneſſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102069:30"/>for truth hereafter. The true ſtate of that matter is this: The Proteſters who had ſeaſonably given a teſtimony before in a Letter ſent to the Generall of the Engliſh Forces, and a duplicat preſented to the Generall Major in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> thought it their duty to meet again about that time, eſpecially to prevent the imminent dangers to Religion, and having ſtayed about fourteen dayes together, and done what became them in their ſtations, and alſo adviſed the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to give a free teſtimony and faithfull warning to their people upon the Lords day, concerning the preſent ſnares and dangers to Religion, which was done accordingly; the Meeting diſſolved. Some Brethren who are for the Publick Reſolutions were in the Town, and had ſeverall diets of meeting at the ſame time when ſuch of the Proteſters as were in Town did meet, upon what occaſion they did meet, was not known, but it was conceived to be for ſtrengthening one anothers hands anent the Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions; and I am ſure there was no meſſage ſent to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters at their meetings by the Miniſters of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> though they were preſent at the laſt diet of their meeting, nor yet by any other, only upon enquiry at theſe of the Proteſters who dwelt in the Town; I find that ſome dayes after the Meeting was ended, ſome of the Miniſters of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> came to one of them, (whether ſent from any other or not, was not made known) and ſaid, That there was a motion amongſt ſome brethren that are for the Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions then in Town, about the Proteſters, and their joyning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a Publick Warning againſt the Engliſh. And his anſwer was, that if they had any ſuch intention or deſire, he wondered why they did not propound it to the Meeting of the Proteſters while they were in Town, and that he could not ſay any thing in a mater of that conſequence without the reſt, eſpecially ſeeing he was not one of theſe who were intruſted by the meeting to confer with theſe brethren about matters in difference; and that ſeing theſe who were appointed would be ready to confer whenſoever Mr. <hi>Blair,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Dickſon</hi> deſired, he thought that it was beſt to propoſe it at ſuch a Conference; When his own privat judgment was preſſed, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That they knew neither he, nor any of the Proteſters, had ſcruple to give teſtimony againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proceedings, for they had already done it both by word and writing. As for this motion of joyning in a Teſtimony with thoſe who were for the Publick
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102069:30"/>Reſolutions, it was new to him and deſerved ſecond thoughts, and he deſired to know if thoſe who were for the Publick Reſolutions, would joyn with the Proteſters in the Teſtimonies which they had given already; &amp; if in the teſtimonies to be given they would teſtifie alike againſt both hands, according to the good old rule and practiſe of this Kirk, and for his own part he could not ſee, if they ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It ſeemeth that this Reviewer is accuſtomed to be very liberal in his language (to ſay no worſe) and that his neighbors allow him the liberty to do ſo, otherwiſe he would have expected to meet with contradiction, and taken better heed to his Relation. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that which he would inſinuat, of the forwardneſs of thoſe of his judgment to give ſuch a Teſtimony, why then did they not (as the Proteſters had done) give a Teſtimony alone by themſelves, but they returned home without doing any thing, though the danger was ſo near, as he ſaith; nor did they any thing to that purpoſe on their ſubſequent Meetings; and for what they did at their late Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, I have ſpoken to it before.</p>

                     <p>THis paſt the Synods in <hi>April,</hi> being invited by that of <hi>Fife,</hi> by their acceptance of their Overture, ſhewed their affection to ſuch a peace with their Brethren, as might not trouble their peace with God; and for that effect did commiſsionate ſome of their
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102069:31"/>Members to come to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to a Meeting in <hi>May</hi> laſt: but that is the next thing they complain, and challenge us of. Firſt, for neglecting to give them timous advertiſement, when yet the very firſt motion of that Meeting in all our Judicatories, was in their prejence, who (if they had been of ſuch a peaceable temper as they talk of) would, no doubt, have made ſuch an invitation welcome, and embraced the occaſion. As for particular adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement to them ſeparately, The Delegats of the Synod of <hi>Fife</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted therewith, uſed all poſsible diligence, a fortnight before that Meeting, diſpatching their Miſſives (which for ought that is known) did not miſcarry; yea, upon their diligence, we found at that Meeting, ſome from <hi>Roſſe,</hi> and others from <hi>Dumfries,</hi> places of very remote diſtance, both South and North: and it is credibly informed, that ſome of their chief leading men wrote both to <hi>Aberdeen</hi> and <hi>Galloway,</hi> deſiring their Complices, not to keep that Meeting. Secondly, they complain, That not ſo much as ſome few dayes of delay could be obtained by thoſe few of their number which were then preſent, whereby they might give advertiſement to others. The truth is, in reſpect of their paucity, they required at leaeſt a fortnights delay (although they had probably a pre-indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meeting, reaſonable frequent, in that ſame place the very week following, and others of them were in Town then, did appear to us, and ſome of them went out of Town immediatly before our Meeting) and ſo long a time could not be given; not only becauſe our Brethren, having come haſtily from their ſeveral owellings, were not able to attend ſo long, and once ſuffered to ſcatter, could not conveniently be gathered again; but eſpecially becauſe having offered unto them a free General Aſſembly (the of old acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged proper remedy of all Eccleſiaſtical diſeaſes) where many of our ſelves might again be preſent, it was plain, that nothing to any good effect could be done till then; and Providence happily caſting that occaſion in their hands, that they might appoint and determin of the place of the enſuing Aſſembly, they could not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ſame to ſlip, which could not be ſhunned, for lack of timous advertiſement to the Preſbyteries, if it were not then concluded. And ſo (which they perceived, thoſe they ſpoke with, directly aimed at) let the Kirk in this difficult time, be ſhaken looſe of her poſſeſſion, of that her dear-bought freedom, which Mr. <hi>Welſh,</hi>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:102069:31"/>Mr. <hi>Forbes,</hi> and other precious men, that now reſt, adventured their lives, and ſuffered baniſhment, to preſerve; as was gravely preſſed home by Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> upon them, in the Conference; and to which they could not ſure they did not, give ſo much as a ſeeming ſatisfactory anſwer. Thirdly, they ſay in the printed Paper, That a deſire of Reconciliation was preſented, but peremptorily, the electing, and ſending Commiſſioners to keep the day, indicted by the Meeting of <hi>Dundee,</hi> was concluded: I know no oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thoſe two, as I conceive any good ſenſe in the former, the one being the end, and the other a mean to it. Beſides, I know no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Reconciliation preſented to them, except the Paper of the Offer of a free Aſſembly, as the proper remedy of our diſtractions. But in the <hi>Autograph,</hi> it is pretended, not preſented; and ſo they moſt uncharitably aſſert, We pretended a deſire of Reconciliation, but had concluded another thing. It is ſo well known in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whether it be We, or they, that uſe to act ſo, that I ſhall onely need to ſpeak to the purpoſe. Our deſire of peace was real, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of it was from them, and we had been very fooliſh and cenſurable, if ever the Lord ſhould bleſs us with another Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, for not walking anſwerable to our truſt in relation to this, if we had not deſigned the place thereof.</p>

                     <p>THe Anſwer which he giveth anent neglecting to give timous advertiſement of their Meeting in <hi>May</hi> laſt, is, That the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Meeting in all Judicatories, was in the Proteſters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and if they had been of a peaceable temper, they had made the invitation welcome: This, I beleeve, is the beſt Anſwer he can give; but he might aſwel have given no Anſwer at all. For firſt, Letters were only written to ſome Presbyteries and Synods, and not to all, and there was not one word ſpoken of ſuch a thing in many Presbyteries, or in their Synods. (2.) In theſe Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or Synods to which Letters came, the motion or overture doth expreſly exclude diſſenters from the Publick Reſolutions, from any adviſe or conſent in appointing that Diet, and is only directed to ſuch as are for the Publick Reſolutions, who are deſired to return their acceptance of the Overture to the Delegats of the Synod of

                        <hi>Fife,</hi> againſt the 28 of <hi>April,</hi> to the end, that upon their receiving of the Anſwer of Synods and Presbyteries, to which they had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, they might, if they thought fit, advertiſe the diſſenters from the Publick Reſolutions to keep that Diet, <hi>May</hi> 12. but in that Letter there was no invitation for them to come, but rather an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation not to come till they were advertiſed concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of the Delegats of <hi>Fife,</hi> upon the return from Synods and Presbyteries. (3) I ſay, the buſineſs was purpoſely ſo contrived, as to make Conference for Reconciliation the pretence, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing was intended, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Commiſſion of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> might meet to determin the place of the Aſſembly enſuing, which had been left in the Indiction under the uncertainty of an Alternative. That Conference for Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was pretended, the Letter of the Synod of <hi>Fife,</hi> and diſcourſe of their Meeting <hi>May</hi> 12. doth evidence, and this Reviewer aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it. That the ſame was not intended, doth appear from this, that a competent time is allowed to acquaint Synods, and where they were not ſitting, to acquaint Presbyteries which were for the Publick Reſolutions; but where Synods and Presbyteries were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Publick Reſolutions, no Letters were ſent to ſuch; but after theſe that are for the Publick Reſolutions are acquainted, and have returned their Anſwers againſt the 28 of <hi>April,</hi> the Letter of the Synod of <hi>Fife</hi> appoints theſe Anſwers to be conſidered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Invitation be given to the Diſſenters from the Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions; and it is no ſecret that it was agreed amongſt them, that ſome men of good eſtimation amongſt the Proteſtors ſhould not at all be invited nor conferred with: Now ſome time muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for them to conſider the Returns, and ſome time to make their Diſpatches to all places within the Kingdom, and ſome time for theſe to whom the Letters were directed, to communicate the ſame to the reſt of the number within their bounds: and ſome time muſt be allowed to ride to <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> all which was not poſſible within the ſpace of thirteen dayes, from the 28 of <hi>April,</hi> to the 12 of <hi>May:</hi> for inſtance, no Letters were written to the Synod of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> where many of the Proteſters live; nor from the Synod of <hi>Fife,</hi> or their Delegats; but one Brother of that Synod writes a privat Letter to another Brother in <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and ſeven or eight dayes of the time were elapſed before the Letter came to his hands,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102069:32"/>whereby it came to paſs that ſome Presbyteries were not at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed, and others, when it was no time to go to that Meeting, 12 of <hi>May:</hi> the like happened in other parts of the Country, and indeed it could not be otherwiſe in places more remote from the Synod of <hi>Fife</hi> (it may be remembered that the ſame art was uſed by ſlighting Advertiſements when they gave their Anſwer to the Parliaments Quire) Further, I deſire it may be conſidered, what this Reviewer ſaith himſelf pag. 9. <hi>viz.</hi> when a fortnight is d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Aſſembly was near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching that they behoved to meet in that capacity (to wit, of a Commiſſion) for determining the place of the Aſſembly enſuing, which had been left in the indiction under the uncertainty of an alternative, by reaſon of the time:</hi> all which laid together, do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſhew that the matter was purpoſely ſo contrived. Next, he ſaith, that ſome from <hi>Roſle,</hi> and others from <hi>Dumfreis</hi> were there upon their diligence; but unleſs he ſay, ſome of the Deſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the Publick Reſolutions, reſiding in theſe parts, were there upon advertiſement ſent from the Delegats of <hi>Fife,</hi> after the 28 of <hi>April,</hi> he ſpeaketh not to the purpoſe; for ſuch as were for the Publick Reſolutions might eaſily be there, for they had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent time, and if any of the Deſſenters from the Publick Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were choſen by Synods or Presbyteries, which at moſt was but one or two, they might conveniently be there alſo, or perhaps ſome might be there occaſionally: but none of theſe will prove his point. That ſome of the chief leading men of the Proteſters, wrote to <hi>Galloway</hi> and <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> deſiring their Complices not to keep that Meeting: For ought I have learned, there was no ſuch thing; and if he can, let him inſtance the perſons, in the mean time I give this inſtance to the contrary, That ſome of the <hi>Proteſters</hi> were there from <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> being choſen by the Synod. He grants that which the Proteſtation alleageth, That the few Proteſters that were there, required a fortnights delay, in reſpect of their paucity, that they might ſend advertiſements to others, but ſaith, That pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably they had a preindicted Meeting, reaſonably frequent, in that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102069:33"/>ſame place the week following. But herein he is much miſtaken, they had no pre-indicted Meeting, but thoſe few Proteſters who were in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> ſuppoſing that their reaſonable requeſt, for a fortnights delay, could not be denied, (if there was any real deſire of peace, concerning which they had charity, till it appeared other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) &amp; did write Letters to all their Brethren that were not far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to haſt unto that Meeting with all diligence, which they did accordingly; and this ſheweth their readineſs to have come in upon advertiſement, but when they came in, the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that are for the Publick Reſolutions, had indicted the place of their enſuing Aſſembly, and ſo having done the buſines for which they came, were gone from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> before the Proteſters were conveened. That two or three were in Town, and did not appear, and ſome of them went out of Town, is little to the buſineſs, their lawful occaſions might divert them, and ſome of them were not called to the Meeting, yea, in effect rather deſired to be abſent; but they came when they were advertiſed. It is a poor ſubterfuge he makes for not granting a fortnights delay, to ſay, they could not attend ſo long or being ſcattered, they could not be conveniently gathered again: Either of theſe might have been done, <hi>if they had been of ſuch a peaceable temper as they talk of</hi> (as he is pleaſed in this Section to ſay of the Proteſters.) But he comes nearer to the truth and ſaith, <hi>It was plain, that nothing could be done, till the meeting of their Aſſembly:</hi> And ſo he may well ſay, conſidering that themſelves had reſolved nothing ſhould be done till then. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he alleageth, There would not have been time to advertiſe Presbyteries anent the place of their Aſſembly: But ſuppoſe the deſire of the Proteſters had been granted, there was abundance of time, there being about ten weeks betwixt the 12 of <hi>May,</hi> and the Diet of their Aſſembly the 21 of <hi>July,</hi> and ſo all the hazards he mentioneth might even in his own way have been prevented. But what if it had been ſo, that they had not determined the place? I cannot conſent to what he ſaith, That the Kirk would have been ſhaken looſe of her poſſeſſion. Doth he know, or hath he forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten what was maintained by the Covenanted Proteſters in 1638. and the Act of the Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſgow, Decemb.</hi> 26. 1638? or the Act of the Aſſembly at <hi>Edinburgh, Aug.</hi> 17. 1639. which was made after ſo much debate about that diſtinction of yearly and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional

                        </gap>rks priviledge of holding Gen. Aſſemblies once in the year, without any addreſs to the Magiſtrate. What if they had been vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſtopped at that time from meeting, would they judge the Kirk to be ſo ſhaken looſe of her poſſeſsion, as ſhe might not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after conveen with the firſt opportunity, and keep yearly Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Aſſemblies without addreſſe to the Civill Magiſtrate, becauſe the adjournment was not keeped: I hope they will not ſay ſo, not make the Kirks priviledges leſſe then Chriſt hath appointed, and the State hath acknowledged there is no limitation in the Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or clauſe irritant in reference to keeping of adjournments: If the Right and Poſſeſſion of the Church did hang on ſo tickliſh a pinne, the corrupt Aſſembly at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> hath much ſhaken and indangered the ſame, for the poſſeſſion of corrupt Aſſemblies doth not maintain the right of free lawfull Generall Aſſemblies, this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgance of theirs is but a fair flouriſh to perſwade people to think well of their way, and of the neceſſity of their refuſing Conference with their Brethren before Conſtitution. As to that he ſaith of Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> and others; Their endeavours were not to ſit and make Acts approving of the Defection of the time, and obligatory of the whole Church as now is done, and that which they were mainly condemned to death for, and ſuffered baniſhment, was for decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the King and his Councell from being judges in Eccleſiaſticall matters <hi>in prima inſtantia;</hi> but the Commiſſion which ſate at <hi>Perth</hi> and their Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> did ſubject the Doctrine of the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt to the immediate cognizance and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Civill Magiſtrate in the caſe of the Miniſters of <hi>Sterline.</hi> There be two ſorts of Miniſters engaged for the Publick Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as hath been touched before, one of theſe was never ready to act for Aſſemblies when they were rightly conſtituted, much leſſe to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102069:34"/>ſuffer for them. As for the other ſort, I do hope when the Lord ſhal afford the opportunity of having Aſſemblies rightly conſtituted as formerly, they ſhall not adhere to the preſent corrupt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor do I think their perſwaſion is ſuch concerning the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reſolutions, when they are free of temptations, as they durſt adventure to ſuffer for the ſame as Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> and other precious men did for the undoubted right, Freedom and Priviledge of this Kirk under the perſecution of King <hi>James</hi> who would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge either right or poſſeſſion of Aſſembles, but maintained that their Meeting and diſſolving ought to depend on his pleaſure, and that they could decree nothing without his conſent or ratification, yet ſetting aſide the Publick Reſolutions which is the grounds of the difference betwixt them and the Proteſters; I do in charity judge, that many of them would ſuffer for the right and freedom of the Kirk. In the end of this Section he would fain quible on the PRINTERS eſcape, in Printing <hi>preſented</hi> for <hi>pretended,</hi> though he grants that in the Autograph it is <hi>pretended;</hi> his zeal leadeth him to quarrel with any that have the leaſt hand about the Proteſtation, even with the PRINTERS Boy, though in ſome Printed Copies the fault be corrected; but I ſay no more, for it's weariſome to trifle the time in anſwering all that he ſaith.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102069:34"/>And how neceſſary it was, in this ſtaggering time, not to change in the leaſt, will be aſſented unto by every ingenuous man, nor know I any reaſon why they ſhould complain: For thoſe to whom the Paper was given were not in a capacity to give an anſwer, till they were firſt Conſtitute in an Aſſembly (yea none but an Aſſembly could ſatisfactorily anſwer their demands, as is evident to, and will be acknowledged by the Judicious Reader) which was no ſooner done then they went effectually about it; But on the contrary the Proteſters would not ſo much as wait till then, but preſently gave in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation.

                     <p>HE affirmes that they did nothing in conſtituting their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, then was done in all the Aſſemblies ſince the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but if he had underſtood wel the Hiſtory of Proceedings in this Kirk, he ſhould have ſaid they did no other thing then was done in the ſix unlawfull Aſſemblies immediatly proceding the laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation (which the Review of the Vindication of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at <hi>St. Andrews</hi> and <hi>Dundee</hi> doth clearly manifeſt, and that they have Conſtituted themſelves in a way contrary to the ſtrain and tenor of the Acts of this Kirk anent Conſtitution of Aſſemblies from our firſt Reformation and if that at St <hi>Andrews</hi> was no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Aſſembly of this Kirk, then the Commiſſion of the Gen. Aſſem. 1650 is ſtill in force, and needed not a new Conſtitution, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion being ordained to endure in the intervall, untill the next free lawfull Generall Aſſembly, and though one half of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers appointed on that Commiſſion by the General Aſſembly 1650
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102069:35"/>have contrary to expreſſe limitations in their Commiſſion agreed on the Publick Reſolutions, and contrary to the eſtabliſhed Order of this Kirk, procured an unlawfull Aſſembly to Ratifie their Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, yet there is twiſe the number of a Quorum of the Members of that Commiſſion which have never aſſented to, nor concurred in theſe Publick Reſolutions. The deſire of the Proteſters to that Meeting at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for not Conſtituting of themſelves, and for entertaining of a Conference, was ſhewed by him who hath the truſt of the Regiſters of the Kirk, and moſt knowledge thereof, to be agreeable to divers practices even of lawfull Aſſemblies in this Kirk, as in the year 1568, 1569, 1578, 1586, 1591, 1597. which was done at the deſire of Mr. <hi>Blair,</hi> and the particulars offered to be inſtructed. The Writer of this Review may remember what ſharp returnes Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> met with becauſe of his Repeating and preſſing theſe things when the Proteſters did remove. As to that he ſaith that they were not in a capacity to anſwer the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Proteſters untill they were Conſtituted, I aſſert, they were only in a capacity to anſwer before Conſtitution, and not after it; for queſtions about conſtitution muſt precede, and not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after conſtitution; therefore it was neceſſary to proteſt preſently againſt their wrong Conſtitution, and it was either a weak anſwer which many of their Aſſembly gave that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment, or a few dayes would annull all their Commiſſions, their being no ſuch limitation or proviſion in their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions nor any Act of this Kirk to that purpoſe; but if the Conference had been granted for the ends deſired, and bleſſed of the LORD with an agreement in the matter of the Propoſitions, there had been no great difficulty to have accorded anent Aſſemblies in time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. The generality of the Godly was not mentioned in the Papers of the Proteſters, without a previous report of godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Profeſſors from ſeverall parts of the Land, though he ſaith he will not mention of whom the Proteſters learned this, and whom in many other things they reſemble, yet the Proteſters are not aſhamed of theſe to whom they were Diſciples in this expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and many other things of neceſſary uſe in the preſent debates, whoſoever ſhal peruſe the Papers of this Kirk in the year 1638 and 1648 may be abundantly ſatisfied that the Proteſters follow the ways and words of theſe who have gone before them in the Work
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102069:35"/>of Reformation. The fifth Argument againſt the unlawful Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is founded upon the ſame ground and <hi>expreſſion.</hi> It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry like they had offended as much if the Proteſters had uſed the words made uſe of in the like caſe by our Predeceſſors againſt the courſe of Defection, which are the equivalent hereof, <hi>viz.</hi> The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the moſt zealous Profeſſors in the Land, no queſtion that was thought by many of that corrupt age as arrogant a Tittle to be aſſumed by the Proteſters of theſe dayes againſt the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that time, as this Reviewer thinks the Tittle of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the godly to be, when it's uſed by the preſent Proteſters. The ſingular teſtimony which he giveth to the Warning and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration at <hi>Dundee</hi> ſpeaks, That he hath a ſingular eſtimation thereof in his heart, above many former Warnings and Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Kirk; I deſire to know if he can with ſo full a mouth, and hearty applauſe give ſuch an <hi>encomium</hi> to the Declaration in the year 1648 againſt the unlawful Engagement, let any indifferent man read &amp; compare them, whether contrary ſpirits do not ſpeak in theſe two Declarations. As to the paſſage cited by him in that War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I Anſwer, That the Proteſters are very far from ſuchways and opinions as the Members of this Kirk are exhorted in that Warning to be ware of; Neither their Profeſſion nor practice doth hold forth any ſuch thing, as that they would <hi>have a Kirk made up of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons only, as do evidence their Regeneration;</hi> they deſire to beware of that extreme upon the one hand; but they deſire alſo to beware of another extreme upon the other; to wit, That a Kirk may lawfully according to the Word of God, be made up of known obſtinate Enemies to the LORD and his Work; and that notorious bloudy Rebels who hate to be Reformed may be admitted to all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt in the Church, and preferred in the State to chief imployments, and intruſted with the defence and preſervation of the Lords Intereſts and People, notwithſtanding they have been and ſtill remain wicked enemies to, and perſecuters of the ſame; there is a middle way betwixt theſe two extremes which the Proteſters do hold according to the Word of God, and the received Doctrine of this Kirk for near an hundred years, and eſpecially ſince the late Reformation, to which rule the Proteſters do adhere, and do hold it their duty to endeavour that they may be obſerved and practiſed as well as they are profeſſed, it being one of the crying and moſt

                     <p>IT is true indeed, and I truſt the Kirk of this Nation hath no reaſon to repent, that ſhe ſtill hath ſome, who (during the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing of the Prelats) were carryed down with the tide of the times, even to give ſubſcriptions according to the then way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and being weighted therewith, do comfort themſelves with <hi>Paul,</hi> that God will be mercifull unto them in that which they did ignorantly. But for thoſe horrid Oaths they speak of, nothing is known but the common ſubſcription: and if ought concern the Kirk to know more, it ſhould neither have been ſo long concealed by thoſe who appropriat to themſelves the title of the Godly, nor now revealed at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a way. As for their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, they were generally known, yet notwithſtanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were the ſubſcribers even at firſt invited to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ſome of them with the firſt appeared againſt the Service-Book, and many of them have not to this day fallen from their ſtedfaſtneſſe, neither were all that have fallen of that number.

                     <p>VVHat the Writer of this Paper doth mean by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſubſcription, I do not well know, if by common he mean that, to which moſt of the Conformiſts did ſubſcribe, I ſay, that was an horrid oath, as doth appear from the Records of their ſubſcriptions. If by common he mean the leſſer oath, and accompt the matter of that oath common; I ſhall ſet down the true Copy both of the greater and leſſer Oath the Conformiſts did ſubſcribe, and let the Reader judge, if the leaſt of the two may not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted horrid enough for a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt to ſwear at his entry to ſuch an holy Calling: the greater Oath ſweateth to practize all the corruptions of the time, and implicite obedience for what ſhould be after concluded, under the pain of deprivation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie and perjury. The leſſer Oath ſweareth ſolemnly to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the corruptions of the time, and particularly for Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the five Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> and what ſhould be lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded thereafter by the Church, as then conſtituted of Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Biſhops, &amp;c. under the pain of depoſition and perjury. The Proteſtation doth acknowledge, that the Lord was graciouſly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give repentance to not a-few who were involved in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and concerning that which he ſaith, that it ſhould neither have been ſo long concealed, nor now revealed at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a way. It is not long ſince it was made known to theſe who have joyned in the Proteſtation, neither had it been revealed now, unleſſe men ſince their ſeeming to repent thereof at the taking of the Nationall Covenant, had by their after-carriage diſcovered their hypocriſie and rottenneſs of their way: beſide, it hath only been revealed in the generall, and the Proteſters have not publiſhed their names. Their ſubſcriptions (ſaith he) were generally known, I grant their conformity was known, but not their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, at leaſt, that it was to an Oath, and ſo horrid an Oath. I do verily ſuppoſe, and not without ground, that ſome who have ſubſcribed, as aforeſaid, have forgotten that the Oath was ſo groſs, otherwiſe why would they deny it, when the ſubſcription is in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102069:38"/>under their hand? He ſaith, ſome of them appeared with the firſt againſt the Service-Book, I think few but ſemi-Papiſts or Atheiſts would have willingly embraced that Book, though fear might prevail with ſome for complyance, but how few of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at firſt againſt Epiſcopacy, and the five Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> to which they had ſworn? He offers five things to clear the matter further, but two of them are coiucident. As to the firſt, for any thing I know or can learn, he can inſtance but one of the number of Proteſters who complyed with the Prelats, which hath be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n matter of humiliation, and a mean ſanctified of the Lord to fit him the more for oppoſing theſe and the like corruptions; he hath now for fifteen years given large proof of the ſincerity of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and hath been very uſefull in his ſtation, for promoting the Work of Reformation, beyond others, of whom more was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. And as for the number of thoſe that ſtand for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reſolutions who ſubſcribed Oaths, or at leaſt practiſed the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of that time, he will finde their number no ſmaller then ſome hundreds. The ſecond thing which he propones to conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is coincident with the fifth, for who did bear the heat and hard of the day in that hour and power of darkneſs, but theſe who ſuffered under the Prelats; yet in the ſecond he ſaith, that theſe of their number were ten for one with theſe that are Proteſters; but upon better conſideration in the fifth he falls down to three for one, and though he had ſaid onely that their number which ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red under the Prelats was equall to the number of Proteſters that ſuffered, he ſhould upon a juſt computation, have found difficulty to make it good; but becauſe he is accuſtomed to ſpeak big words, I ſhall paſs this as a brag to beguile ſimple Readers, though I think I might ſay, the ſufferings of the Proteſters were greater; but bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the Lord for the faithfulneſſe of all that ſuffered. As to the third, I do ſo far differ from him in my computation, and (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) I know the Proteſters near as well as he, that I can ſcarcely find twenty of them under ſix years ſtanding in the Miniſtery, which then concurred in the Proteſtation, though bleſſed be the Lord <hi>their number increaſeth.</hi> If he can help my memory in two or three that will be the moſt, he ſaith, that about five of them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were Miniſters when the Nationall Covenant was ſubſcribed, which is about fifteen years ſince, I can find him about five times
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102069:39"/>five, who were then Miniſters, that joyn in the Proteſtation; and there be diverſe more who are unſatisfied with the Publick Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, though they adhere not to the Proteſtation. And what great advantage is this, I pray you, that he ſo earneſtly hunts after? Whether is it more commendation for ſeverall of the Proteſters that were ready to have entered into the Miniſtery, to forbear to enter, by ſubſcribing to ſuch ſinfull Oaths; or for many of theſe that are for the Publick Reſolutions, that they entered by ſuch a corrupt way, and ſo were Miniſters when the National Covenant was ſubſcribed? would this argument have any weight with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious men againſt Mr. <hi>George Gilleſpies</hi> teſtimonies for the Cauſe of God, becauſe he entered not into the Miniſtery till after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation began. 4. He ſaith, that generally all the old Miniſters and theſe that were admitted before the Epiſcopall encroachments, are for the Aſſembly. The defection began in 1597. and upon King <hi>James</hi> his entry to <hi>England,</hi> (which is about fifty years ſince) the Epiſcopall incroachments began, and all oppoſers of the defection were diſcountenanced, and ſuch as were for it, favoured and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the King, State, Biſhops, and corrupt Aſſemblies: for my own part, I know few that can be of that ſtanding in the Miniſtery, but I know ſome who have been about that time in the room of the Miniſtery, who are not long ſince depoſed for inſufficiencie and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, and like enough there be more of that ſort. Let this Reviewer do the worſt he can to caſt aſperſions and reproaches upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſters, I do believe that in no time of the defection of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of this Kirk, there can be produced ſo great a number of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witneſſes that adventured to give in Proteſtations againſt the corruptions of the time; and theſe on either hand alſo.

And why did the Moderator of their late Aſſembly tell them, that the depoſed Miniſters both thought and ſaid, they had many good friends amongſt them? The Proteſters were never accompted guilty of that fault, and himſelf afterward challengeth them for being of a rigid purging humor, ſo I know not what tranſgreſſions of the like nature he hath to charge them with. He grants in his fourth Obſervation, that the epithets may be applyed if the Party were ſuch as is deſcribed, when he ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider what hath been ſaid for evidence thereof, he may perhaps change his judgment about them, or at leaſt, not defend them ſo confidently.</p>

                     <p>THat the Publick Actings were for bringing in of the Malignant party, to places of power and truſt, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring down ſuch as had been ſtreight in the Cauſe, ſtirring up the Civil Magiſtrate againſt them, and ſubjecting the liberty of the Word in the mouth of Chriſts Ambaſſadors, for reproof of ſin, to the immediate judicial cognizance, reſtraint and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Civil Magiſtrate, will appear a maſſe of malicious reproaches, by ſhortly ſetting down the true ſtories related to: But I muſt first tell that the odicus term Malignant doth not appertain to them, who having ſatisfied for their offences of that kind, according to the Order preſcribed by theſe mens own aſſent and advice, keep themſelves free from new out break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that abjured iniquity; And if we walk not according to this rule, many of them will be forced to hear, what for the preſent I purpoſe not to ſpeak. And next adde, That all the birds of their feather were not ſo ſtreight in the Cauſe, as they would ſeem to inſinuate here: And on the other part, ſome, whom they term Malignants here, have given unqueſtioned evidence of their affestion to, and are ſtill ſuffering for that Cauſe. Now, the Stories related to, are theſe two; The one ſo well known, that we need no more but remember how, when, and upon what pinch of neceſsity, (which themſelves know how it came) the Commiſsion of the Kirk being enquired by the State, who might be employed for the neceſſary defence of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try at ſuch a time: The Commiſsion of the Kirk gave that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which their duty to GOD, their Mother-Kirk, Native Country, and the Proteſtant Intereſt, extorted from them, and which all Nations and Incorporations whatſoever, will, and do allow and practiſe in ſuch a caſe. But, that People may rightly judge of it, for it is ordinarily miſ-repreſented, we deſire them to get, and ponder the Commiſſions own Papers. The other
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102069:41"/>Story is ſhortly (in ſo far as it is moſt material) thus; It being repreſented by the Committee of Eſtates, to the Commiſsion of the Kirk, what hazard the Garriſon of <hi>Sterlin</hi> was in, by their Miniſters there preaching, and otherwaies dealing, they withal ſignified how they behoved to take ſome courſe for ſecuring the ſame the Commiſsion deſired their Lordſhips, that they would not meddle with the matter, till they had firſt dealt with them, and returned their report of the Iſſue, which being aſſented to, the Commiſsion wrote for them to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> where they met with them; and when by conference they would not receive ſatisfaction, began to entreat them firſt to give aſſurance that they would not obſtruct the Levies, but this they refuſed: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that they would be pleaſed (for Peace ſake) to with draw for a ſeaſon from <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and they would provide their places; but this they alſo refuſed, although Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> then (apparently a dying) did gravely obteſt them, hoth for the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which being repreſented to the Committee of Eſtates, and they thereafter informed, how thoſe Miniſters conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in their former practice, they wrote for them once, and again to come to <hi>Perth;</hi> But ere they came the moſt part of the Committee being removed to the North) they who remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned deſired them to ſtay at <hi>Perth</hi> or <hi>Dundee,</hi> till the reſt ſhould return, againſt which they proteſted in very high terms, as encroaching upon the Miniſtry, &amp;c. By the time the reſt returned the Parliament did ſit, who deſired the Judgment of the Commiſsion, whether or not the Committee of Eſtates had made any encroachment upon the Miniſtry and Government of this Kirk, by detaining theſe Miniſters and give their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice what courſe the Parliament ſhould take in relation to them, for ſecuring the Garriſon of <hi>Sterlin;</hi> the ſumme of the Anſwer thereto was, The Brethren might lawfully proteſt, that nothing be done prejudicial to the Liberties of the Kirk; but that they did not ſee that the Committee of Eſtates had eneroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched thereon, by that which they had done; and that they could
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102069:41"/>give no advice to their Lordſhips, the ſecuring of a Garriſon being a thing not competent to them. After which, ſome of thoſe Miniſters friends entreated ſome of the Commiſsion, to deal with the Parliament, to let their Brethren go home, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking for them, that they ſhould not further offend; which the Brethren of the Commiſsion did, engaging themſelves to be anſwerable for their carriage; whereupon they were preſently diſmiſſed. This being the true Story, let any judge of the truth of the former Calumnies.</p>

                     <p>TWo things he denies, and ſaith they are malicious reproaches: The firſt is, the in-bringing of the Malignant party to places of power and truſt; one while he pleads their repentance, and would have them to be no Malignants that have made a faſhion of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, without any evidences, yea there were contrary evidences in their ſpeeches and actions: and ther while he pleads neceſſity for it, and ſaith, the Proteſters know how it came; which is true indeed, though not perhaps in his ſenſe: They too well know from ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, how that neceſſity was plotted and contrived at the <hi>Hague</hi> and <hi>Bredah</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and how the deſign was driven on in Court, State and Kirk in <hi>Scotland,</hi> all other neceſſities were but pretended; and what neceſſity is that, which ſhould make a People, confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God in a ſolemn Covenant, to give up the Lords Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Intereſts and People, to the power of his and their Anti-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted Enemies, whoſe hands have been, more then once, imbrued in their blood. Then he referreth to the Commiſſions Papers, for further ſatisfaction; but theſe have been ſufficiently anſwered by former Papers, to which no Reply hath been given. I find in the Commiſſions large Paper, in anſwer to the King and Parliament, concerning the Miniſters of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> this Defence of their Anſwer to the Parliaments Quaere, which is brought forth by them, with confident words as an undeniable Argument Either the Malignants will ſatisfie, or not ſatisfie; if they ſatisfie, then they muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Covenant and Ordinances, and if to theſe, then they may be admitted to fight for Religion, King and Country &amp;c. If
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102069:42"/>they ſatisfie not, then they are to be Excommunicated; and by the Publick Reſolutions Excommunicated perſons are excepted from being employed. The Vindication of their Aſſembly hath another Anſwer, that the Publick Reſolutions were <hi>indeterminati juris,</hi> as to any former Aſſembly. Where firſt I deſire it to be obſerved, how one Defence interferreth with another. What a ſad buſineſs is berk? ſome few Members of the Commiſſion without advertiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſent to others, do, at the deſire of the State, determine a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Doctrine with great precipitation; contrary to received and known principles: and then they ſtrain their wits to deviſe ſeveral ſorts of Arguments to maintain the ſame. (1) What a ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is here of Thouſands all on a ſudden, following upon an Act of Parliament? beſtowing places, though juſt now, many of them were in Arms againſt Religion and their Country, and others on their way to joyn with them. The State firſt nominates Malignant Officers, and then they come to make a bare ſhew of repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Commiſſion of the Kirk, and they accept it. (2) Obſerve, that it is not true which is alleaged for defence of the Commiſſion, that they preſcribed good Rules, but the State tranſgreſſed them; for according to the Commiſſions dilemma, brought to maintain their Reſolutions, the State did not tranſgreſs the limits preſcribed when they nominated perſons not yet Excommunicated, for ſaith the Commiſſion, If they ſatisfie not, they are to be Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo are excluded; and to ſay the truth, the State could not think that the Commiſſion judged any to be obſtinate enemies, or notoriouſly flagitious, who neither were Excommunicated, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der proceſs of Excommunication; and ſo the Commiſſioners of the Kirk were chief in the Tranſgreſſion, for they did not Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cate any one Malignant in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but ſhortly after their Anſwer did relax from Excommunication a chief Malignant, who had been Excommunicated a little before their Anſwer, for being a Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader of a preſent Rebellion. (3) How contrary is that to former Principles, to reaſon from mens being admitted to Repentance, to their Employment in Places of Truſt (for that is the thing complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of in the Proteſtation, and anſwered by this Reviewer) the Acts of Aſſembly 1648. 1649. and 1650. and Declarations of the Commiſſions of the Kirk, ſpeak expreſly againſt employing of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants, notwithſtanding any outward ſatisfaction: Is not the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102069:42"/>Acknowledgment of our great ſin, in employing Malignants, made particularly in relation to the employing thoſe who had given ſatisfaction to the Kirk? for none were employed in places of power and authority but ſuch as had firſt ſatisfied the Kirk. Doth not the Aſſembly 1649. expreſly diſtinguiſh betwixt Admiſſion of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants to Repentance, and their Admiſſion to Truſt; which, even in Kirk Seſſions, is diſcharged without expreſs warrant of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly? And then (4) As to their Repentance. How few of the great multitudes admitted, were received, according to the Order preſcribed in the General Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and the General Aſſembly 1649? Upon Evidences, it was in the judgment of many judicious and pious men, the very Cape-ſtone of that Defection, that the Lords Ordinances were made to ſerve the corrupt ends and deſigns of men, and the mocking of Repentance, made a patent way to Truſt and Preferment: What better was it, then if the Prieſts of old had admitted Lepers into the Lords Houſe, and then to excuſe themſelves, had pronounced them all to be clean when the Leproſie had ſprung up and ſpread in their bald-head; that certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould be accompted a double guilt. As for thoſe, which he ſaith, are free from new out-breakings, all that I know of that kind will hardly exceed (that which we could only call) a perfect num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, their Repentance is very rare; it is too manifeſt that many of them have, according to their mutable principles, gone from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream to another. For his boaſts of what he can ſpeak, of any of the Proteſters, they fear him not, only let him ſpeak no more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after then he can make good; which is the beſt way to bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into credit again.</p>
                     <p>The other thing which he denyeth in this place, is, The ſubjecting of the liberty of the Word in the mouth of Chriſts Embaſſadors, to the immediate judicial cognizance, reſtraint and cenſure of the Civil Magiſtrate. This is ſo fully cleared in the Review of the Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as I need, ſay nothing in anſwer to the Relation here made, only I obſerve this difference betwixt the Vindication and this Reviewer, that the Vindication denieth that the Magiſtrate confined the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> being ſtarred up thereunto by the Commiſſioners of the Aſſembly; and the Writer of this Paper, to avoid the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that may be made upon the Magiſtrates judging them <hi>in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma inſtantia,</hi> ſaith, That the Magiſtrate did conveen them upon a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102069:43"/>Repreſentation made by the Commiſſioners to the Committee of Eſtates, but he knoweth that the Commiſſion of the Kirk had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed no judgment againſt theſe Miniſters, nor indeed could they, walking within the bounds of their Commiſſion; yet did they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Proceedings of the State, without ſo much as hearing the Defence of theſe Miniſters, though preſent in the ſame town where they were ſitting.</p>

                     <p>HOw offenſive muſt this needs be both in the ears of God and good men, that one who pretends to be a Patron of an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the Kirk, ſhould ſo publickly and ſcornfully reproach that neceſſary and covenanted duty which the Aſſemblies of the Kirk and their Commiſſion, in their Declarations, Warnings, and Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, above the number of Twenty, have preſſed upon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Committee of Eſtates, from the Word of God and our Covenants, as they would avoid the Lords eternal wrath on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and a curſe upon the Land, and ſtill challenged them as neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and defective; in all which the men of moſt deſerved eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Aſſemblies had a very great hand. The Cauſes of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation preſented to the State before <hi>Dumbar,</hi> at <hi>Leith,</hi> and the Cauſes after <hi>Dumbar</hi> at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> ſhew and acknowledge, the not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purging the Judicatories and Armies, according to our Vows and Profeſſions to be a great cauſe of the Lords wrath upon the Land;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102069:43"/>afterward he would ſeem not altogether to condemn the duty, and would ſtate the diſterence upon the manner, and by the words he ſpeaks and texts hinteth, he ſeems to deſiderat juſtice, prudence, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and what not? It would pleaſe ſuch a Maſter far better to ſit idle then to work; but ſuch, to whoſe hearts the Lord hath made the language of His Words to ſpeak, though they do readly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a great mixture of humane infirmities in their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all duties, yet they are ſo far from thoughts of repenting what they have done in that matter, as they deſire to mourn before the Lord that the work of purging hath been ſo much ſlighted in all Judicatories both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil: Sometime he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>values the Proteſters as a company of young men of ſmall accompt, and at other times he holds them forth as men who had a great ſway in Judicatories of Kirk and State. He ſaith, Purging was made a politick ſcrew, to wind into Power and Authority in Kirk and State. To which I anſwer in his own words, <hi>That ſuch hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous accuſations muſt not be taken upon truſt, when nothing is ſaid to make them appear;</hi> eſpecially when they are ſpoken by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who takes more pleaſure to reproach then to reaſon. I am ſure if it was before acceptable in Judicatories to ſpeak for purging, it is now more acceptable to ſpeak againſt it, and I think I may in the fear of the Lord, deſire good men who were very induſtrious and zealous for purging the Houſe of God, the Judicatories and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and now are engaged in the way of the Publick Reſolutions, to conſider the boldneſs of this man (whom they do well enough know) and either to take with the thing he charges upon their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer actings, and to let the world know that then they were wrong, but now are right, together with the Reaſons of their change, or elſe to be ſenſible of their lifting up the head of ſuch men, by decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to their way, and to remember whence they are fallen, and to repent.</p>

                     <p>TO the firſt I anſwer, that he doth well to grant, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent expreſſions and former actings of the Proteſters do agree, the like cannot be ſaid of all that are for the Publick Reſolutions, though it be too true of many of them, the Proteſters are indeed for purging out all inſufficient, ſcandalous &amp; il-affected; but that is very far from judging ſuch as come not up the full length that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; he knoweth what meaſure faithful Miniſters and Profeſſors got in their Acts at <hi>Dundee,</hi> and he may remember his own intimation page 5. of a neceſſity to hold them as Heathens and Publicans. To the ſecond. I ſay, that they do neither often aſſume, nor at all appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priat (as he ſaith elſwhere) the title of Godly to themſelves, the ſubſcribers of the Proteſtation are ſpeaking of others to whom theſe of beſt accompt in their Aſſemblies, will not deny the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of godlineſſe; and yet when they are reproached and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they may even concerning themſelves, uſe ſome freedom in their Vindication, for which there be diverſe examples in Scripture. To the third, ſeeing that Aſſembly to which the Proteſtation was preſented, accompt themſelves a Judicatory, why did they not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the relevancie of the grounds, and then they might have deſired the Proteſters to prove them, wherein if they had failed, the Aſſembly had the greater advantage, but they were loath to put the buſineſſe upon that iſſue. To the fourth, I deſire him to conſider what Mr. <hi>John Knox</hi> ſaid to the Councell of <hi>England,</hi> when they challenged him for doing contrary to the Publick order, his reaſon was (ſaid he) becauſe their Publick order was contrary to Chriſt's order: And ſo is their Publick order at <hi>Dundee</hi> contray to the firſt good old conſtant order of this Kirk, eſtabliſhed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Word of God, which was to be very watchfull in admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Miniſters, as appeareth by Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> his laſt Letter to the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102069:46"/>Generall Aſſembly, a litle before his death. But doth not the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Paper know, that ſome depoſed Miniſters are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted contrary to publick Order of the Aſſembly 1649, and 1650, in ſeverall places, and particularly within the Synod of <hi>Tividale</hi> and <hi>Mers?</hi> I believe he is not ignorant of it, and however, I am ſure a great part, if not the moſt part of the Aſſembly did know it: and the whole Aſſembly might have known it, if they did examine Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod-Books and their Proceedings.</p>

                     <p>THe Prophets words were well conſidered before they were ſet down in the Proteſtation, and they are very applicable to the Party of which the Proteſters ſpeak. It is known to the World what ſome of the Proteſters have done for maintenance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this Kirk; I may ſay of them all without any boaſt, that they have done more for it, then any who queſtion the reality of their Profeſſions. There is no doubt but it is the Devils deſign to ruine Generall Aſſemblies, and every Ordinance of Chriſt if he could, but the way by which Satan hath moſt advanced that deſign hath been through their own corruption, and when they were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, oppoſition hath little prevailed.</p>

                     <p>HEre he bends all his endeavours to make it appear, that the Proteſters incline to ſeparation; but he anſwers not what is ſaid in the Proteſtation for their vindication, to wit, that their ways are agreeable to the principles and practices of their Predeceſſors and the Non-conformiſts in <hi>England,</hi> he brings four conſiderations why the profeſſions of the Proteſters are not believed. Firſt, he ſaith, that the Proteſters ſtill took the patrociny of all that were ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to follow theſe wayes; but what doth all this amount unto? For he ſaith not that they patronized theſe who followed, but theſe who were ſuſpected to follow the wayes of ſeparation. It is well known that too many have an evill eye againſt Reformation, and have ſuſpected all that hath been done theſe fourteen years in the Lords Work, as tending to ſeparation: But what will he ſay for his aſſociats, who have not onely taken the patrociny of men ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for Malignancy, but of theſe that were condemned and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102069:47"/>for being murderers of the People of God; yea, and what if they have recommended them to Publick truſt and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment? To that which he alleageth in the ſecond place, I anſwer, that this is the old Prelaticall ſong againſt the Non-conformiſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome of their number turned Separatiſts: therefore to ſay that they were all for ſeparation, though they keeped Chriſts middle way between extreams, and did much more againſt Separation by Word, Writ and Print, then all the Prelaticall Party; And I may ſay the like of the Proteſters, that they have taken more pains by word and writ, to prevent and remedy the declining of ſome to the ways of Separation, then all that are for the Publick Reſolutions have done. Beſide he would conſider what is ſaid in the Repreſentation which was given in before the Proteſtation: <hi>How great a ſnare your former actings which were not to edification have been to ſome people to tempt them to the way of ſeparation, and to the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the government of this Church, &amp;c.</hi> He may alſo bethink himſelf what great numbers of theſe that were moſt zealous for the Publick Reſolutions, have either departed from their Principles to the contrary way, againſt which they were fighting the former year; or otherwiſe, if they be ſtill walking upon their principles, it is true which the Proteſters a leage, that the Publick Reſolutions lay a foundation for conjunction with all parties whatſoever. To the third I ſay, that he hath forgotten the rules recommended by him to the Proteſters in the preceding page, anent purging out ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious, inſufficient and ill-aſſected Miniſters. Will he not allow the ſame moderation to men reputed godly, when they fall into an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of judgment? He recommended to the Proteſters conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19 <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>Brethren, if a man be over-taken in a fault, ye which are ſpirituall reſtore ſuch an one in the spirit of meekneſſe, conſidering thy ſelf left thou alſo he tempted.</hi> He recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended alſo <hi>Jude</hi> 22 23. <hi>and of ſome have compaſsion, making a difference, and others ſave with ſear, &amp;c.</hi> I wiſh theſe rules had been obſerved in the excommunication of ſome: for raſh cenſures, bring authority in contempt. I adde unto theſe another place, 2. <hi>Theſs.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>and if any man obey not our word by this Epiſtle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, and yet count him not as an enemy, but admoniſh him as a brother.</hi> And I ſay no more, but deſire that he and his party may
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102069:47"/>be as ſtudious to obſerve theſe rules in their cenſures, as the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are deſirous to make conſcience of keeping theſe rules in their converſation. As for his fourth conſideration, he miſtakes the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, there was more in the caſe of non-concurrence with the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Kingdom, then aſſociation with Malignants: for the ſtate of the quarrell was changed from what was agreed on by State, Kirk and Army, before the fight at <hi>Dumbar,</hi> as hath been ſhewed before. Next, the intereſt and ends of the War were changed, when the Malignant Party became the predominant and prevalent part in Judicatories and Armies; It is one thing to joyn with a few evill doers in a great Army: It is another thing to joyn with the Congregation of evill-doers, and where notorious evill doers bear the ſway and rule in government. There was a third thing, that though all were clear anent the unlawfulneſſe of the Invaſion, and did concur to oppoſe it; yet very needleſly ſeverall were made to ſcruple in their actings, and their hands were weakened by the States ſlighting and rejecting the offer of a Treaty for peace, which was made by Generall and Councell of the Engliſh Forces not long after the fight at <hi>Dumbar,</hi> ſeeing it had been an eaſie matter in a few dayes to have made tryall and diſcovery, whether there was any reality in that offer or not, but not ſo much as an anſwer was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by word or writing to that Letter, notwithſtanding that it was once reſolved on by the moſt part of the Members of the Committee of Eſtates that were then preſent at <hi>Sterline.</hi> Now it is evident, that theſe things are of a different nature from the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion about ſeparation from worſhip, becauſe of the ſins of follow-worſhippers. But yet further I ſay, there are many clear differences betwixt non-concurrence with the Malignant Party in Arms, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Publick Reſolution &amp; ſeparations from the Ordinances of God, for the ſins of fellow-worſhippers: for in acts of worſhip, the effect is to every man according to his faith, but in fighting together there is one common effect reſulteth to all, &amp; all muſt ſhare therein, according as the Lord diſpenſeth a victory or defeat; now the Lord is with his friends and bleſſeth them, and againſt his enemies and curſeth them, therefore <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> and <hi>Amaziah</hi> are forbidden conjunction with Iſrael, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. and 25. And to expreſſe it Further, I give this Inſtance, that when men joyn in Armes, they fight one for another; but in participation of the Sacrament they
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102069:48"/>do not Communicate one for another; alſo there is no implicite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to be given in Acts of Worſhip as there muſt be in war in ſome caſes: For inferior Officers and Souldiers are ſworn to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by their military Oath, and if they ſhould refuſe untill they underſtood a reaſon for the command given them, 't would be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mutiny, and worthy of death: Therefore friends, and not our bloudy Enemies are to be intruſted as Commanders, likewiſe there are not ſuch Commands, Prohibitions and Covenants in the one caſe as the other; and we ſee in Scripture that <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maziah</hi> are forbidden conjunction with the Iſraelites in war, yet incaſe the ſame Iſraelites had come to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to Worſhip, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſaphat</hi> and <hi>Amaziah</hi> had been obliged to joyn with them in Acts of Worſhip; there be diverſe other differences, but becauſe they are ſet down in other Papers for anſwering the ſame Objection, I ſhall not repeat them here. In the laſt place I ſhall add a further conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and that is even in the caſe of abſtaining from conjunction with theſe that not onely come the length of profeſſion, but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to eſſay to joyn themſelves with the Church, which it ſeems this Reviewer doth condemn as altogether unlawfull in any caſe whatſoever. There is great difference betwixt open enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord and his Work and bloudy perſecution of his People, and betwixt common ſcandals; theſe two are not to be confounded together, for actuall enmity ſuſpendeth the duty of all relations, ſo long as it is continued, even between Father and ſon, and husband and wife, at leaſt theſe duties which cannot be performed without reall danger; for natures light teacheth, that one would not truſt himſelf on the ſame bed or roum with another whom he had found diverſe times endeavouring to cut his throat; but common ſcandals do not ſuſpend the duty of relations, for a ſon is bound to do duty to a father under cenſure for groſſe ſcandals. Before <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi> the Remonſtrators did joyn in Armes with known ſcandalous perſons, yet they would have ſcrupled to have joyned in Councels and Armes with notourly treacherous Rebels, that had been active and frequent in ſhedding the bloud of the Lords People, unleſſe they had ſeen evidences that they had repented of that enimity: But to make good what is before ſaid, ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 9.26. The Diſciples at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> were all afraid to joyn with <hi>Paul</hi> who had been a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, and believed not that he was a Diſciple, though he eſſayed
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102069:48"/>to joyn himſelf to them, and no doubt <hi>Paul</hi> being ſo wiſe a man, and knowing how great offence his former carriage had given, did declare to ſome of them the manner of his converſion, when he did eſſay to joyn himſelf, yet he could not obtain this without <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> his teſtimony to the Appoſties anent the ſincerity of his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; It is wel ſaid by <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place, <hi>&amp; timendum erat ne periculum ſibi temerè accerſerent ſi prabuiſſent ſe adeo faciles ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que timorem illis juſta de cauſa conceptum nemo vitio vertere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, nam ſi ad reddendam fidei rationem vocati fuiſſent non</hi> Paulum <hi>mode, ſed omnes inferorum furias intripidè provocaſſent.</hi> It is the judgment of ſome Divines upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 16, 17, 18 that <hi>Paul</hi> had then been three years preaching after his Converſion at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and in <hi>Arabia,</hi> before he came to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> which if ſo, may further ſtrengthen the Argument if there were need; and however <hi>Acts</hi> 22 18. Such was the Lords gracious condeſcendence (far different from the imperious and boiſterous way of rulers upon earth) that though upon right information concerning <hi>Paul,</hi> all ſcruples might have been removed, yet he gave command to <hi>Paul</hi> to depart from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, make haſte</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and get thee quickly out of Jeruſalem, for they will not receive thy Teſtimony concerning me;</hi> As for <hi>Pauls</hi> anſwer although Interpreters differ about the meaning thereof, yet it is moſt probable that his words are a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of what the Lord had ſaid, and an humble confeſſion that they had reaſon to ſcruple in receiving his Teſtimony; and if <hi>Paul</hi> had been offering a reaſon to the Lord for his ſtay at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as ſome think, he would have added ſomething about the reality of his Converſion, as <hi>Barnabas</hi> did for him, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.27. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Lord reneweth his Command, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>Depart for I wil ſend thee far hence to the Gentiles.</hi> Theſe conſiderations, together with the preſent practice of the Proteſters may ſuffice to Vindicate them from ſuch calumnies.</p>

                     <p>IT is to be obſerved, that where the Proteſtation upon good ground ſaith, <hi>That the ſecend Aſſembly after this laſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation hath clearly determined the keeping and authorizing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Generall Aſſemblies to have been one of the chief cauſes of the many evils which have befallen this Church;</hi> he onely ſaith that <hi>it affirmed that theſe corrupt Aſſemblies were a chief cauſe &amp;c.</hi> If any of the Proteſters had ſpoken ſo barely of ſo ſolemn an Act and determination of the Generall Aſſembly, it had been a Crime to have been noted with great Letters; but he alſo paſſeth over theſe words, <hi>keeping and authorizing theſe corrupt Aſſemblies,</hi> which are the words of the Act, and of no ſmall uſe in this debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and the Proteſters; and if the late Aſſembly be corrupt, the forbearing to keep them, and to concur for authorizing them is ſo far from ſeparation, that it is a duty ſo to do. In the next place, I obſerve that he ſeems to grant the nullity of the late Aſſemblies, if they be like unto the ſix corrupt Aſſemblies, either in matter, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or reaſons condemning the ſame; and if he ſhall be pleaſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to peruſe the Review of the late Vindication, he may ſee their likeneſſe in all the three, though he yeeld that one of them is enough; As to that bitter ſcoff, ſaying, <hi>That the Proteſter I know many of their Proſelytes will take upon truſt whatſoever commeth from them, or ſeemeth to borrow countenance from</hi> Glaſgow.

                     <p>VVHen the Proteſters bring Arguments from the Word of God, from ſworn Covenants, and the Acts and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of this Kirk, to prove a defection in this Kirk, and that in the Publick Reſolutions they have departed from former Principles then this Reviewer takes himſelf to generall Arguments from the light of nature, and ſelf-preſervation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which ſheweth that he hath nothing to anſwer in particular to the Arguments brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102069:50"/>them: Many Acts and Declarations of this Kirk have been made uſe of in former Papers againſt the Publick Reſolutions, but never any one Act or Declaration could be produced for them; all their arguments from the light of nature have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered formerly by the Proteſters, and it hath been ſhewed that it is againſt natures light to aſſociate with actuall enemies and bloudy rebels, they have but a poor plea to plead before conſciences bar, to ſay that nature taught them to pronounce abſoluution to all the Malignant Party, and to declare them friends to the Lord, his Work and People, without evidences of Repentance, to the end they might be ſtrengthened by their help and aſſiſtance for defence of Religion and the Country. It is a ſad matter that Miniſters of the Word of God, who ſhould magnifie the Law and make it honourable ſhould make it a hand maid to the light of nature, whereby it is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord may be provoked to remove Scripture light from his ſeers, and to let them walk in the light of their own fire, and in the ſparks which they have kindled. I do not eaſily believe, that he who delights ſo much in reflections and aſperſions againſt theſe whom he diſliketh, would paſſe any by-paſt acts of the Proteſters (as he ſaith) if there were any thing he could with any ſhew of reaſon quarrell, yet he concludes the Proteſtation was needleſſe, and the grounds of it frivolous, and he would fetch a proof hereof from themſelves, becauſe they ſay they do <hi>Proteſt for all or ſome of the reaſons following,</hi> which ſaith, he doth inſinuate that <hi>ſome of them wil not hold water:</hi> But he wittingly omitteth in the ſame place that they do alſo Proteſt upon the grounds before mentioned, wherein they all did agree, and theſe alone had been ſufficient to infer the concluſion. The true reaſon of that expreſſion, <hi>for all or ſome of the reaſons following</hi> was this; There were amongſt the Proteſters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the late corrupt Aſſembly at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> diverſe who were fully perſwaded concerning the ſinfulneſſe of the Publick Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and accounted the Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> corrupt, for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet had ſome doubts anent the form, but perceiving this year a corrupt conſtitution continued according to that corrupt act, and rule of conſtitution of Aſſemblies made at <hi>Dundee,</hi> they were clear, that it was their duty to Proteſt againſt this Aſſembly at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> as corrupt in the form and conſtitution: But the moſt part by far were clear, that it was a duty to Proteſt againſt the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102069:50"/>of that Aſſembly at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Dundee,</hi> yet did not judge it expedient to make two ſeverall Proteſtations becauſe of this difference when they agreed in the main: Therefore that all might joyn in one Proteſtation, that manner of expreſſion was uſed; and what hath this Reviewer to inſult in againſt the Proteſters when all the matter is, that the number of the Proteſters againſt the late Aſſembly at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> is increaſed above the number of Proteſters againſt their Aſſembly at St. <hi>Andrews.</hi>

                     <p>HE is ſtill in the wrong to ſay the Proteſters beg the Queſtion for what is aſſerted in the Proteſtation was before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereof, clearly proved in former Papers; he doth often caſt in the Proteſters way that Vindication, but it ſeems he had not then ſeen the Review of that Vindication, elſe he would not think it difficult to be anſwered; he doth by this time know (I think) that it is anſwered in all the parts thereof, and very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in that concerning the Argument of the Remonſtrants of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> which is well refuted and retorted. In this place he alleadgeth that the Proteſters ſecond reaſon includeth a falſhood: But if it be a falſhood, it is one of his own deviſing, and yet he would impute it to the Proteſters, for he doth forſt in two words, at two ſeverall places; in the firſt place he puts in the the word <hi>[and]</hi> in the ſecond place he puts in the word <hi>[ſame]</hi> then in the third place he leaves out the word <hi>[conſtituent]</hi> and ſo altereth the ſenſe of the words; the words of the Proteſtation are theſe, <hi>It is constitute after the ſame manner for the moſt part of the Members conſtituent, as the former protended Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, of perſons which were authors and abetters of and have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on a courſe of defection,</hi> of which words he maketh this falſe repetition, <hi>that it is conſtitute after the ſame manner and for the moſt part, of the ſame Members that the laſt Aſſembly was, &amp;c.</hi> And yet he would charge the Proteſters with a falſhood; how like is this to the Thief that did ſteal his Neighbours pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

That the moſt part of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers conſtituent of the Aſſembly at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> are Authors and Abettors of, and have carried on a courſe of defection, as the Members conſtituent of the pretence Aſſembly at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> had done contrary to the Word of God, Covenant, ſolemn Acknowldg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                     <p>THe third reaſon is, becauſe of the pre limitation of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, by the Acts made at <hi>Dundee</hi> injoyning Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods and Presbyteries to proceed to cenſure all who oppoſe the Publick Reſolutions, or ſhould not acquieſce to the Acts made at <hi>Dundee,</hi> and ſo excludeth all not involved in the courſe of defection, from Elections, in purſuance whereof, there were ſundry pre-limitations made ſince, by ſeveral Synods and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries. For anſwer, I would enquire with what conſcience this Argument is proponed by them, who (for ought I know) are clear againſt the major, and cannot be ignorant of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or nullity of the minor. Their major muſt be, no Aſſembly that is pre limited, can be free. But to paſſe the judicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations thereof in the learned Vindication, ſure I am, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will never aſsent to any Aſſembly in this Kirk, without ſtrange prae-limitations, yea and prae-concluſions too; as they did ſignifie at the Meeting and Conference in <hi>May</hi> laſt.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102069:52"/>Such as may nullifie an Aſſembly? No ſuch thing.

Or the Aſſembly of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> becauſe the Tables appointed and laid down away who ſhould be elected thereto, and who not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> Or all future Aſſemblies, becauſe that of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> excludeth from them all that ſhall not take the National Covenant? Whither doth their paſsion lead them to plead the Epiſcopal cauſe? Beſides, did not the Letter of the Commiſsion in <hi>May</hi> laſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of Presbyteries to chuſe faithſul and honeſt men? Which whatever ſome have ſaid, was no ſinful pre-limitation. Adde, although the Act of <hi>Dundee</hi> requires Presbyteries and Synods to proceed with the Cenſures of the Church againſt them, who after conference oppoſed the Publick Reſolutions (not as they ſay, with a disjunctive, or who ſhall not aquieſce to the Acts made) yet hath no Presbytery nor Synod that I know, cenſured any upon that accompt, or excluded any from voicing in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; but rather all Presbyteries did require them thereto. Now, if they might elect, they might alſo by the ſame reaſon be elected; but themſelves fore-ſeeing that, in few Presbyteries obtainable; where ever they were, they refuſed and diſſented, being probably themſelves pre-limited by the order and advice of their Ring-leaders. Laſtly, it is at beſt, needleſly added, that there were ſeveral limitations ſince, in ſeveral Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, I beleeve there will be nothing elſe found but the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> The aſſertion of the Conſtitution of the Aſſembly of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi> which we will not grant, and they cannot prove to be ſuch a pre-limitation, as is deſtructive of the freedom of an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</p>

                     <p>CErtainly this Reviewer either hath not read and conſidered the Reaſons of the Proteſters upon this ſubject, or otherwiſe it would ſeem he is <hi>valde perfrictae frontis,</hi> that can enquire with what conſcience this Argument is propounded. He ſaith, their <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> muſt be, no Aſſembly that is prelimited, is free, and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not he ignorant of the vanity of the <hi>minor:</hi> But their Argument is, That no Aſſembly prelimited in the free Election of Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners by ſecluding and making uncapable thoſe who may, and ſhould be choſen according to the Acts of this Kirk; and by inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſolely thoſe, who according to the Acts of this Kirk, are unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, is a free Aſſembly: But ſuch was this late pretended Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Proteſters never aſſerted, nor aſſented unto ſuch pre-limitations, and pre-concluſions as this Reviewer ſpeaks of; and he doth well to ſuppoſe that there were ſuch pre-limitations in their late Aſſemblies; but he is much to blame that he ſtudyeth to confound pre-limitations of the freedom of an Aſſembly, with due qualifications of its Members, agreeable to the Word of God, to our Covenants, and the Conſtitutions of this Kirk, as if theſe were one &amp; the ſame. If he think that in the Rules of Conſtitution of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> or any other Aſſembly ſince that time preceding their late Aſſem. at <hi>S. Andrews,</hi> there was any other thing required but theſe due qualifications of Members before mentioned, let him ſpeak out, that his mind may be known; and for their Act and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Publick Papers 1651. and their late Acts at <hi>Dundee,</hi> exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all that differ from the Publick Reſolutions: he will never be able to prove thoſe to be ſuch: he is begging the Queſtion indeed, when he ſuppoſeth that Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> to be a free lawful Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, determining the qualification of Members. He tels us, that in the Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> all were excluded that did not take the National Covenant: But that was no prelimitation of due freedom, it was a requiſit qualification. Indeed, if the Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> had ſecluded all that did take the Covenant, from being Members of any Aſſembly, and had appointed, that Aſſemblies ſhould conſiſt only of ſuch as had oppoſed the Covenant, and concurred in the courſe of Defection, as the late Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> hath done in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102069:53"/>the caſe of the Publick Reſolutions; it had been a prelimitation of the freedom of Aſſemblies, and it had been great unfaithfulneſs not to have given teſtimony againſt the ſame. It would ſeem by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which this Reviewer hath framed, That if the Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> had brought in the Prelats and Service-Book men, to be Members of the Aſſembly at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he would have ſuſtained it to be a free lawful General Aſſembly, for ſaith he (very looſly, without reſtriction according to the Word of God, Covenants and Conſtitutions of this Kirk) a prior Aſſembly determined the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of its Members. Surely theſe who have brought in the Malignant party <hi>iiſdem viis modis &amp; methodis,</hi> may bring in the Prelatical party, and thereafter the Popiſh party. The Covenant is as expreſly againſt Malignants, as againſt Prelats and Papiſts. Both Prelats and Papiſts can diſſemble aſwel as the Malignants, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended neceſſity may be ſoon found out for ſeeking their help, and aſſiſtance for relief of a diſtreſſed Land.</p>
                     <p>The Letter of the Commiſſion in <hi>May</hi> laſt, did require the chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Commiſſioners to the Aſſembly, to be done according to the known and ordinary Rules of Election. Now if the Authority of that Commiſſion of the Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> be acknowledged, how can any man conceive that they underſtand by known and ordinary Rules any other then theſe which are eſtabliſhed by the Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> from whom they had their Commiſſion, it being a known and ordinary Rule, not to chooſe ſuch to be Commiſſioners as were cenſured by the laſt Aſſembly, or whom they appointed Presbyteries to proceſs and cenſure; and ſo all that differ from the Publick Reſolutions muſt be excluded from Election, which, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever this Reviewer hath ſaid, is a ſinful pre-limitation. He gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that the Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> did by their Act, require Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Synods to proceed with the Cenſures of the Kirk againſt them, who after conference oppoſe the Publick Reſolutions; but all the Copies which I have ſeen or heard of, have alſo this disjunctive, Or who ſhall not acquieſce to their Acts and Conſtitutions; but the difference is not great, ſeeing they well know that ſuch who for conſcience ſake cannot acquieſce, will, as they are called thereunto by providence, teſtify their diſlike of the Publick Reſolutions, which in the judgment of men zealous for the Publick Reſolutions, will be accompted oppoſition. But, ſaith he, The Presbyteries have
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102069:54"/>not put theſe Acts into execution. I deſire to know how he will reconcile their principles and practiſes herein; for if the Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> did right in making theſe Acts, the Presbyteries do wrong in not executing them; the forbearence of the Presbyteries is either from policy, as was done in their Aſſembly at <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> which is well diſcovered by the Review of the Vindication. Or it is from conſcience, becauſe the Presbyteries do think that the diſſenters from the Publick Reſolutions deſerve not cenſure, but are capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elected Commiſſioners, and if ſo, then the ſame conſcience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but tell them that the Acts at <hi>Dundee</hi> are wrong and unjuſt. As for the prelimitations in Synods, he ſaith they were nothing elſe but an aſſertion of the Conſtitution of the Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee.</hi> But that Conſtitution was made up of perſons ſcandalous for defection from the Covenant and Cauſe, which was never denied in this Kirk to be deſtructive of the freedom of an Aſſembly, except at this time, and in former corrupt Aſſemblies. If it were needful, Acts, Orders, and practiſes of Twenty General Aſſemblies can be produced againſt the admiſſion of ſuch to ſit as Members; but that controverſie is ſo well handled in the Review of the Vindication, as it ſtandeth not in need of my Additions.</p>

                     <p>TO the fourth Reaſon of the Proteſtation he anſwereth cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly.

As for his Anſwer to the firſt of theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he granteth, That unjuſt excluſion rendreth the Meeting ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to exception. And I truſt, it is ſufficiently proved in the Review of the Vindication and Papers printed therewith, That there is an unjuſt excluſion, by the Acts made at <hi>Dundee,</hi> which ſtand ſtill unrepealed, and in effect acknowledged by the Aſſembly at <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> And if the Act at <hi>Dundee</hi> anent the Conſtitution of Aſſemblies be acknowledged to be juſt and right, then ſubſequent Aſſemblies, otherwiſe conſtituted, are by the Acts of this Kirk null and void; ſo that until that Rule of Conſtitution, made at <hi>Dundee,</hi> be diſclamed, Whether oppoſers of Publick Reſolutions be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted or not) ſubſequent Aſſemblies are ſtill queſtionable; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was a neceſſity to proteſt, or elſe to give way to a corrupt Conſtitution of Aſſemblies hereafter, which is as poiſon in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, a defect in the cauſe, an error in the principles and foundation, and hath an univerſal influence in the ſtreams, effect and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102069:55"/>He affirmeth, that theſe Presbyteries which refuſed to ſend Commiſſioners, were legally warned: But there can be no le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal warning, where there was no Authority to give a warning. He granteth there were diſſents; but denieth (in his Anſwer to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Conſideration) that there were any Proteſtations made in Presbyteries, but Proteſtations were only needful in thoſe Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries which refuſed to put Diſſents upon record. To the reſt of what he ſaith there, I ſay no more, but if he had known that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Presbyteries did ſend two or three of their number, warranted by Commiſſion, to proteſt; he might have ſpared his cenſure of a ſuppoſed tautology.</p>

But here (I think) a ſpecial providence hath ruled, that there was no Proteſtation. In moſt Presbyteries there were no diſſents at all; and all that we heard of, were ſimply againſt the Elections, not againſt the perſons elected beſides that; they were not proſecute, nor brought in, to be diſcuſſed. And a diſſent inferreth not by the Act of the Aſſembly a ſuſpending, let be a repealing of the Act of the Judicatory; Only it maketh the Judges liable to the cenſure of their Superiors, for what they have done; which if it be amiſs, the diſſenter is not involved in their guilt or cenſure; but if not, he is cenſurable himſelf.

A ſtrange aſſertion, and of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. This Proteſtation was given in at the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Aſſembly, ere ever it was conſtitute, and that upon the delay of taking in their firſt Paper; and is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable they could gather all their conſents in ſo ſhort a time? Or, had they them before? But that ſmelleth of a prae-meditate Faction: Or go their reſolutions along with whatſoever theſe Proteſters do? But that is not ſuitable to them that are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly godly, to have their faith pinned to the ſlieves of any, how high ſoever they hold their head. Or is it that they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low none to be of the number of the godly, who go not along with them in every thing? This (I ſuſpect) be the marrow of the matter: But who gave them that power to put out and put in into the Roll of the Godly, whom they pleaſe? And as we doubt of their authority ſo to do, even ſo alſo of their power: can they reach the heart, or are they quicker ſighted then <hi>Elias,</hi> who ſaw not one of the ſeven thouſund God had reſerved to himſelf? Will they condemn all for ungodly, that are not of their way? How ſuiteth that with their profeſsions elſwhere? I am ſure, we have here reaſon to diſſent and appeal from ſuch an uncharitable cenſure of them that have no power, to the righteous Trihunall of the Lord, to whom we ſtand. There may be ſomewhat more yet of dangerous conſequence in it, in that they ſeem to ſubject the Publick Miniſteriall authority to the People; and amongſt them, to ſuch onely as are viſible Saints, where, if there be any myſtery, they will do well to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold it.</p>

Now, in all this, what is there of a prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated faction?

They are very far from rigid cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring of others, as this writer would have the world to believe, there are many whoſe judgments are for the Publick Reſolutions, who wil be loath to accompt all Profeſſors in the Land to be godly, and in their Sermons and otherwiſe, they do make a difference amongſt Profeſſors, as well as the Proteſters do, and they alſo do very well know, that the Proteſters do not ſubject the Miniſteriall authority to any other, but unto their Maſter from whom they have their Commiſſion, and to the Officers thereunto appointed in the Church according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. yet they do deſire to render all due reſpect to the Saints, ſo far as they are known unto them, and do acknowledge, that they have ſo far an intereſt in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as that they cannot be denyed a judgment of diſcretion; and when they ſee corruption in government, to ſupplicat for a redreſs. And what for a Miniſter of the Goſpel is he, that will not lay more weight upon the judgment of ſuch as live according to godlineſſe, then upon the judgment of ſuch as lead a life directly fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it?

The Brethren who ſtand for the Publick Reſolutions are ſo far from wayes of peace, as they refuſe all conferrence, except they Treat and conſer as the lawful Repreſentative of this Kirk, and be cloathed with their Commiſſion and Authority; and therefore their Anſwer to the Overture is returned in the Name, and by the Authority of a Commiſſion of the Kirk, and a Committee is by Act of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Commiſſion, appointed for that purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator and ſome Brethren of the Presbytery of <hi>St. Andrews.</hi>

                     <p>The ſaid Anſwer declareth, That no Agreement is to be expected upon other terms then the late pretended Aſſembly at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> did propoſe; for the Anſwer doth affirm that they have found that the ſaid Aſſembly hath endeavored to the utmoſt of their power to compoſe the preſent differences, and did condeſcend upon ſuch O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures as poſſibly they could perceive moſt conduceable to that end.</p>
                     <p>Now, theſe Overtures, by them mentioned, do require an expreſs paſſing from all our former Teſtimonies, and that in time coming we ſhall never give any Teſtimony againſt the Publick Reſolutions, and other late corruptions and novations brought into the Church, for it is required to be ſet under our hands, <hi>That we ſhall not hold up debates by preaching, writing, or otherwiſe, for any thing which doth concern the late differences that hath ariſen in this Church:</hi> So that we may not give Teſtimony or declare our Judgements in any caſe, but muſt either be altogether ſilent in theſe things, or elſe conform our language to the judgment of the pretended Aſſembly, and if any Miniſter or Elder cannot in conſcience comply with theſe Overtures, though they be men eminent for gifts and graces, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102069:63"/>have been very uſeful and profitable ſervants in the Lords Vinyard, and differ in nothing in judgment with their Brethren in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, Directory for Worſhip and Government, yet they muſt be caſt forth as unſavory ſalt, becauſe they cannot agree to a Novation which never was heard of before in this Church, and which themſelves in their Vindication grant to be <hi>indeterminati juris.</hi> The ſame ſeverity is enacted againſt expectants to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and they muſt be debarred for this ſole cauſe, though they were never ſo wel qualified. If this be not Uſurpation and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the Prelats are very excuſable for their carriage.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Obſerve how their Anſwer to us, and Letter to the Presbyteries is ſtufled with carnal policy, and very far from that ſimplicity and candor which becometh Miniſters of the Goſpel. They ſay, they are deſirous to have the memory of our differences and diſtractions buried, yet with the ſame breath they give out ſentence, That we have not only been agents, but active agents, and vigorouſly active; and affirm this to be conſpicuous, not only to ſome, but to all who have been looking on the matter. But were it ſo, what need was there to tell it? If they would have theſe things buried, why did they aſſemble ſo frequently this Summer, to dig them out of their grave? Were it not greater ingenuity to tell the truth (as ſome of their number do) that theſe Publick Reſolutions muſt ſtand as the Authority and Warrant for the Body of the People, to riſe all in Arms (without making diſtinction of Friends and Enemies to the Lord his Work and People) and aſſociate among themſelves, and with Forreigners, when they ſhall land with the King. They ſay, they will not queſtion, whether we did from a deſire of removing differences, forbear to act in the capacity of Commiſſioners from the General Aſſembly 1650. yet in the very next words they do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly queſtion it, and ſay, It ſeemeth not to conſiſt well with our Anſwer to the Synod of <hi>Lothian.</hi> This is but a ſeeming incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency grounded on a real miſtake; for the Overture mentioned by us, is not the ſame with that, propoſed by the Synod of <hi>Lothian,</hi> neither for the Matter, Perſons, Propounders, or the time of making thereof: It was a more equal Overture then that from the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Lothian,</hi> for it did not condemn the Authority of the Commiſſion 1650. more then that of 1651. as that from <hi>Lathian</hi> did; and it was propounded at a Conference with ſome of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102069:64"/>of the Presbyterie of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and that diverſe moneths after the Overture made by the Brethren in <hi>Lothian:</hi> If our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren had been well adviſed they had ſpared this reflection. They ſay, they abſteined from meeting ſo much as to adjourn the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and that to prevent the heightning of differences til the time of the Aſſembly did approach that they behoved to meet. I will not ſay, as our Brethren do, That I will not queſtion if it was for that end they did abſtein, and then follow it with a contradiction; I do plainly and ingenuouſly profeſs, That I think it was another reaſon which made them abſtein: It was a clear caſe to all who converſed with them at that time, That fear of interruption by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and drawing prejudices on their perſons, made them abſtein, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Malignant party (their penitents and correſpondents) began to have power and favour, and procured ſome under-hand aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for their ſecurity. And it may be well remembred, that their Meeting at that time in <hi>May,</hi> before their Aſſembly, was coloured with ſpecious pretences, of uſing endeavors for union with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters from the Publick Reſolutions; yet here they plainly tell us, that the expreſs end was, To determine the place of the enſuing Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; to which I do readily give credit: for they ſlighted the ſending advertiſement to us, and would not delay one fourthight at the earneſt deſire of ſome few of our number, that were preſent at that Meeting. They ſay, they could not delay to conſtitute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a General Aſſembly without unfaithfulneſs, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they know that it was agreeable unto the practice of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Gen-Aſſemblies, to adjourn without conſtitution, and no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice at all to their Liberties, as was repreſented to them at the ſame time. They ſay, that it hath been conſtantly holden in this Church, That a lawful General Aſſembly (ſuch as this was) is the moſt ſoveragin mean to heal ruptures &amp; diſtractions in the Church. If they take out theſe words <hi>[ſuch as this was]</hi> which they have foiſted in to deſtroy the Text, their own conſciences will bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us, that we are of the ſame judgment: But to ſay, That a pretended Aſſembly, made up of ſuch as have brought in Novations and carried on a courſe of Defection, &amp; continuing therein without Repentance, is a Soveraign mean to heal ruptures and diſtractions, is ſo far contrary to all reaſon and experience, as it hath proved to be a main cauſe of the evils and troubles of this Church, as is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

For firſt, They act what they had a mind to act, in reference to matters in difference; and then after their Meeting is diſſolved, and no ſooner, they declare to us they will act no more at that Meeting, nor hereafter, till the third Wedneſday of <hi>Febr.</hi> and that is the time of their next Quarterly-Meeting. 2ly, This ſeeming forbearence to act during that time, is not general, but limitted to the matter of cenſures, 3ly, That's clog'd with another limitation, for ſay they, We muſt leave Synods &amp; Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries to that prudence and diſcretion which the exigence of their condition ſhall require, for putting in execution the Acts for debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Elders from Voting in theſe Judicatories, and Expectants from the Miniſtry, which themſelves the laſt year did accompt to be no ſmall Cenſure, in the debarring Malignants from truſt; but how much more in this caſe, which hath great influence to corrupt the Miniſtrie and Judicatories. 4ly, Their expreſſions which they choſe in their Letter to the Presbyteries and Synods, are ſuch, as do rather incite to Cenſures, then prohibit; for they inſinuate a diſlike of their former moderation in Cenſures, which (they ſay) is well known to them, and to all men. 5ly, They well knew by the Conference which we had with them in <hi>July</hi> laſt, that it was not their Cenſures we feared, or much valued, but that we deſired that both of us might be in the accompt of either in a fit capacity to confer together, and not they looking on us as Delinquents at the bar, and themſelves as our Judges; otherwiſe we ſee not to what good purpoſe we ſhould meet. 6ly, The time, place, way, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Perſons (which indeed is leaſt of all) ought to have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geeed upon by mutual conſent; yet even in theſe ſmaller matters they muſt keep a ſtate and authoritatively enjoyn all, without the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102069:65"/>giving us the leaſt intimation of their Reſolutions, till they were ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and the Meeting was adjourned. In the cloſe of their Paper they would fain vindicate themſelves from perſecution, but they would conſider, that juſtified defection endeth ever in perſecution of the witneſſes againſt it. Some, who at the begining of this Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, abhorred the very ſuppoſition of troubling any godly Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who differred from them in judgment, within ſome moneths were perceived to make no great ſcruple to help forward the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution: others, who called it a perſecution the laſt year, to debar Malignants from Civil and Military Truſt, will have it this year no perſecution to debar godly and faithful Elders, from Truſt in the Kirk; and able, gracious and well qualified Expectants, from the Miniſtry: Conjunction with Gods Enemies, is alwaies attended with perſecution of his Friends; and experience may teach us, that large Charity to Malignants wil dry up much former love to Gods People. Mans heart is deceiptful above all things. I ſay no more, but I deſire heartily to pray the Lord, to forgive them the deed and thing, who ſtorm ſo grievouſly to be told of the name of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>

                     <head>Obſervations upon the ſame Act.</head>
                     <p>A. THere was neither ſuch-fair hearing allowed, nor ſuch due examination uſed, nor ſuch mature deliberation taken as was requiſite in ſuch a caſe, anent which ſuch a multitude of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſters, Elders and Profeſſors in the Land had ſo great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction in their conſciences; For, 1. Albeit the moſt materiall and important of theſe proceedings of the Commiſſion (to wit, their anſwers and reſolutions about imploying ſuch as were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly excluded) were of things which the Authors thereof ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not to have been determined by any of the former Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of this Kirk, as is granted in the Vindication of that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; yea, of things which to their knowledge were in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many gracious ones in the Land, contrary to many Acts, Warnings, and Declarations of former Aſſemblies, and to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the Word of God, yet as the Commiſſion had at firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the ſame in a very thin meeting at <hi>Perth,</hi> not only before communicating the ſame to Presbyteries, and hearing their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there-anent; but the greateſt part of their number being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and many of them not being at all advertiſed; ſo did that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> go on very ſuddenly, notwithſtanding that a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay was moſt earneſtly deſired at <hi>S. Andrews</hi> where they firſt met, and that it be expreſſely provided by an Act of the Aſſembly 1639, That no Novation which may diſturb the Peace of the Church, and make diviſion, be ſuddenly propounded and enacted; but ſo, as the motion be firſt communicated to the ſeverall Synods, Presbyteries and Kirks, that the matter may be approved by all at home, and Commiſſioners may come well prepared, unanimouſly to conclude a ſolid deliberation upon theſe points in the Generall Aſſembly. 2. Albeit many things were offered unto them, both from the Scriptures and Reaſon, and from many Acts of former Aſſemblies againſt the proceedings of the Commiſſion, and the approving thereof; the reading of a part whereof, to wit, Sir <hi>Archibald Johnſtoun</hi> of <hi>Wariſtoun</hi> their own Clerk his Letter, was much preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at ſeverall Diets by many of their own number, yet were not theſe things heard, nor taken in conſideration, nor could the reading
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102069:68"/>of that Letter be obtained, notwithſtanding that it was once pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly promiſed by the Moderator.</p>
                     <p>B. Would to God their wiſdome and faithfulneſſe in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their truſt had been ſuch as might juſtly deſerve ſuch a commendation; but we fear that upon examination, it ſhal be found not to have been ſo: 1. Becauſe they did not keep themſelves within the bounds of their truſt, which was to treat and determine in the matters referred unto them, as their Commiſſion expreſſely bears; but it was not referred unto them to determine Caſes not formerly determined by any Aſſembly of this Church, there is no ſuch clauſe in their Commiſſion; yet did they determine a very grave Caſe, to wit, the imploying of theſe who were formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, which by the chief Authors of that determination, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to have been <hi>indeterminati juris,</hi> a fault that was the greater, becauſe it is provided by the Acts of the Generall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly 1641, That ſince it hath pleaſed God to vouchſafe us the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of yearly Generall Aſſemblies, that no novation in Doctrine, Worſhip or Government, be brought in or practiſed in this Kirk, unleſſe it be firſt propounded, examined and allowed in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Aſſembly. 2. Becauſe they did not onely go beyond their truſt, but walk contrary unto their truſt, great part of their truſt was, to preſerve the eſtabliſhed Doctrine, Diſcipline, Worſhip and Government of this Kirk, againſt all who ſhould endeavor to bring in any contrary thereunto, to cenſure Complyers and perſons diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to the Covenant, according to the Acts of the Aſſembly, and to proteſt againſt all encroachments upon the Liberties of the Kirk; in all which three they failed: 1. In the matter of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Doctrine, not onely becauſe they taught and allowed, that Malignants being Subjects, might be imployed and intruſted for defence of the Cauſe and Kingdom, as appears at length in their Warning of the date <hi>January</hi> 
                        <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> 1651. and in their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Letter of the Presbyterie of <hi>Stirling</hi> at the ſame Diet, notwithſtanding that the contrary had been conſtantly taught and holden by this Kirk theſe years paſt, but alſo were inſtrumentall unto the actuall imploying and intruſting of theſe men, which as to man could not but prove deſtructive to the Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Government of this Kirk. 2. In the matter of cenſuring Complyers and Perſons diſ-affected to the Covenant, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102069:68"/>to the Acts of the Aſſembly, becauſe they did not onely allow perſons who were not of conſtant integrity and affection to the Cauſe, and of a blameleſſe and Chriſtian converſation to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed and intruſted, which was contrary to our Solemne Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but alſo becauſe they take off Cenſures which had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly inflicted upon many diſ-affected perſons, who had not in their ordinary converſation, given reall teſtimony of their diſlike of the late unlawfull Engagement, and of the courſes and wayes of Malignants, and of their ſorrow for acceſſion to the ſame, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly, notwithſtanding that this was expreſſely provided by the Act of the Generall Aſſembly 1649. and did ordain Presbyteries to cenſure all ſuch Miniſters within their bounds as did oppoſe or bear teſtimony againſt theſe their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. 3. In the matter of proteſting againſt encroachments upon the Liberties of the Kirk, becauſe when ſome Miniſters were confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at <hi>Perth</hi> by the Civil Magiſtrate for their doctrine, before they were cited or ſentenced by any of the Judicatories for the ſame, they were ſo far from proteſting againſt this, that as they were ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent when theſe Miniſters were firſt cited, notwithſtanding that the Letter of citation was communicated unto them by the Committee of Eſtates; ſo by a Publick Paper given in to the Parliament, they did condemne the Proteſtation of theſe Miniſters againſt that cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confinement, which Paper is eſpecially approven in this Act.</p>
                     <p>C. It is not our purpoſe to fall upon the particulars which are ſaid to be eſpecially approven here; but by the word <hi>eſpecially,</hi> and by the particulars which are here mentioned, it is evident that the ſpirit which ruled in the Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> was zealous above meaſure for the Publick Reſolutions, moſt of all the Proceedings of the Commiſſion that relate thereunto, or to the oppoſers thereof, or any Teſtimony given againſt the ſame, being particularly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and eſpecially without leaving out, much leſſe excepting ſo much as their Act concerning the oppoſers of Publick Reſolutions, and Letter to Presbyteries thereupon, by which all of them were appointed to be cited as perſons guilty to the Aſſembly, and ſo were excluded from having any hand to treat or vote therein in any thing concerning the Publick Reſolutions, which beſide the injury done to the perſons, was to prae-limit the Aſſembly, and to make it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102069:69"/>up of ſuch onely as did approve of their Proceedings.</p>
                     <p>D. The generality of Malignant and diſ-affected perſons in the Land, who have been enemies to Reformation and godlineſſe, do joyn in this high teſtimony, and cry-up theſe proceedings and the Authors thereof, as deſerving high commendation, but moſt of the godly of the Land refuſe to put to their ſeal thereto, and make theſe proceedings the matter of their mourning, begging pardon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto the Authors thereof.</p>
                     <p>E. This is another evidence, what ſpirit led that Aſſembly, as every thing muſt be cried up that made for ſtrengthning of the Publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, ſo every thing muſt be cryed-down that made for weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof; yea, that very Declaration which before <hi>Dumbar</hi> was unanimouſly condeſcended upon and approven both by the Commiſſion of the Kirk and the Committee of Eſtates, for holding forth the true ſtate of the quarrell upon which the Kingdom then fought, and for ſhutting out every Malignant party, or quarrell, or intereſt. 1. By inſinuating that it hath already been to ſome a ground of unwarrantable proceeding in theſe words of their Act: <hi>To the end it may not hereafter be to any a ground of unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proceeding in reference to the Kings Majesty, or any of his Succeſſours.</hi> 2. They take onely one clauſe of the whole Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to wit, that <hi>the Kings Intereſt is not to be owned but in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to God,</hi> leaving wholly out another materiall part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to wit, <hi>and ſo far as he ownes and proſecutes the Cauſe of God, and diſclaims his and his fathers oppoſition to the Work of God, and to the Covenant, and likewiſe all the enemies thereof;</hi> which is again repeated thus in the cloſe of that Declaration, <hi>and that they will with convenient ſpeed take in conſideration the Papers lately ſent unto them, and vindicate themſelves from all the falſhoods contained therein, eſpecially in thoſe things wherein the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell betwixt us and that party is miſ-stated, as if we owned the late Kings proceedings and were reſolved to proſecute and maintain his preſent Majeſties Intereſt, before and without acknowledgment of the ſins of his Houſe and former wayes, and ſatisfaction to Gods People in both Kingdoms.</hi> The omitting of which Clauſes doth ſo ſar as I can diſcern either from the Aſſemblies own words, or from the judgments and expreſſions of theſe who had chief hand therein, or from comparing things with things, indeed import an
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102069:69"/>altering of the ſtate of the queſtion, and brings it to that which was ſo much pleaded for by the oppoſers of Reformation from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beginning of our differences with the Kings father, eſpecially by ſome of the Authors of the croſſe Petition in 1643. and of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Engagement in the year 1648. to wit, that though the King did not diſclaim his former oppoſition to the Work of God and to the Covenant, and likewiſe all the enemies thereof, and own and proſecute the Cauſe of God, yet we ought to owne his Kingly Intereſt, by admitting him to the exerciſe of his Royall Power, and obeying him in al things lawful, which how far it reacheth, as to the caſting looſe, and condemning of the former proceedings of this Church and Kingdom with the King and his Father, and making a new ſtate of the queſtion, hath been often heretofore ſhewen by this Church, and cannot but be obvious to every intelligent man.</p>

                        <p>THeſe three Acts I have put together, becauſe they are much of the fame or like nature, that is, ſuch as ordain cenſures upon theſe who do not acknowledge the authority of that Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> or who ſhall not acquieſce to the Acts and Conſtitutions thereof, or who ſhall not paſſe from the Proteſtations againſt theſe two pretended Aſſemblies at <hi>Dundee</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and I offer unto the Reader theſe animadverſions upon them: 1. That in the firſt Act at <hi>Dundee,</hi> the Act of the Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> 20. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemb,</hi>
                           <pb n="13" facs="tcp:102069:71"/>1638. Seſs. 26. is not faithfully made uſe of, but by leaving out of ſome words, is ſtretched beyond the ſenſe and meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, The words of that Act <hi>Decemb.</hi> 20. 1638 are, <hi>that all ſuch as are ſcandalous and malicious, and will not acknowledge nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce unto the Acts thereof, be cenſured according to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and contempt.</hi> But at <hi>Dundee</hi> theſe words, <hi>ſcandalous and malicious</hi> are left out, and the cenſure is extended to all perſons that do not acknowledge that Aſsembly, how blameleſs or holy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be in their carriage, or how tender or ſober ſoever they be in not acknowledging the ſame. 2. Whereas the Act of <hi>Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow</hi> 1638. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 18. Seſs. 24. Ordains <hi>Presbyteries to proceed with the cenſures of the Kirk to excommunication againſt thoſe Miniſters only who being depoſed, acquieſce not to their ſentences, but exerciſe ſome part of their Miniſterial function, refuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and withdraw others from the obedience of the Acts of the Aſſembly.</hi> By the Act at <hi>Dundee,</hi> all perſons whatſoever who ſhal ſo do, are made liable to excommunication. That the ſin and ſnares of theſe three Acts may be the better underſtood, I deſire a ſhort view to be taken. 1. Of the thing that is thereby made cenſurable. 2. Of the cenſures themſelves. 3. Of the perſons who fall under that cenſure. The thing that is made cenſurable is, the not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of that Aſsembly, or not acquieſcing to the Acts and Conſtitutions thereof, or refuſing to paſs from the Proteſtations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the two late Aſsemblies, &amp;c. things that are in themſelves not cenſurable, but commendable, not ſins but duties, as is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrated in other Papers and Treatiſes which are already publiſhed; becauſe that Aſsembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> was no free nor lawful Aſsembly.</p>
                        <p>The cenſures contained in theſe Acts are either in reference to places and truſt in the Church, or in reference to Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and communion as Church-members. The cenſures of the firſt kind are either for keeping from places and truſt, or for removing from the ſame. The firſt are relative. 1 to Expectants, ſtudents of Divinitie, attenders upon Families, who by the ſecond Act at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi> and by their extending the Act of the Aſſembly 1640. Seſſ. 10. are declared uncapable of a Pedagogie, teaching of a School, cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing of a family, preaching or catechizing in a Congregation, or of a Burſary, or of liberty to reſide within a Burgh, Univerſity or
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102069:72"/>Colledge, or of any other priviledge and liberty allowed to Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctants And by the Act at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> it is provided, that if any of them be called to a particular charge of the Miniſterie, that the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie ſhall not admit him to his trials, unleſſe he do under his hand paſſe from the Proteſtations againſt theſe two Aſſemblies at <hi>Dundee</hi> and at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and promiſe and give aſſurance never any more to open his mouth, nor put pen to paper againſt the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reſolations, and the things that have followed thereupon, which they expreſſe by abſtaining from holding up Debates and Controverſies about matters of Differences in this Kirk, ſince the Aſſembly 1650. which if he do refuſe, that there ſhall be no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in his tryals till the next Generall Aſſembly, and that in the mean while liberty be left to the Presbyterie and Congregation to plant the place otherwiſe. 2. To Ruling Elders coming to ſit and act in Presbyteries, who by the Act at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> incaſe of their refuſall to perform the things formerly mentioned, the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are ordained not to admit them to act as Elders in the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie. Theſe cenſures that concern removing from places and truſt, are determined in regard of Elders in Presbyteries, and Expectants to preach or catechize in Families or Congregations, or have Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, for both theſe (if they do not condeſcend to the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions) muſt unjuſtly be removed and diſcharged, the Elder from ſitting in the Presbyterie, the Expectant from his preaching or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing, or burſarie. Concerning Miniſters they are not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, but leave it to Presbyteries, to proceed according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the offence; yet ſo, as there be clear ground laid for their ſuſpenſion or depoſition; yea far more, becauſe they not onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point cenſures equivalent to the ſuſpenſion or depoſition of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters upon Expectants and Elders, and have gone before by their own example, ſuſpending ſome Miniſters, and depoſing others: but do ordain Presbyteries and Provinciall Aſſemblies, to call before them all perſons that do not acknowledge that Aſſembly at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi> and to cenſure them; and do alſo in the beginning of the firſt Act declare, That all perſons who proteſt againſt, and decline the authority of the Generall Aſſembly, are cenſurable by the Acts and Conſtitutions of this Kirk, with the higheſt cenſures of this Kirk; and in the body thereof do declare, That the two Acts of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> 1638. (The firſt whereof ordains Presbyteries
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102069:72"/>to proceed with the cenſures of the Kirk to excommunication) are not onely to be extended againſt Miniſters cenſured at <hi>Dundee,</hi> but alſo againſt all thoſe that oppoſe the Publick Reſolutions thereof.</p>
                        <p>The cenſures that relate to Church-fellowſhip and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are deſigned in the firſt Act, which ſtrikes equally againſt all perſons whatſoever, who are Church-members, Miniſters, Elders, Expectants and Profeſſors, who if they do not acknowledge that Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> are appointed to be cited and cenſured accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the degree of their contempt and obſtinacy againſt the Acts of this Kirk, and if they oppoſe the Reſolutions, or do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce to the Acts and Conſtitutions of that Aſſembly, then to be proceeded againſt and cenſured according to theſe Acts at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> which are extended unto them; now the not acknowledging or declining the authority of the Aſſembly is in their conſtruction in the beginning of this Act, cenſurable with the higheſt cenſures of the Kirk, according to the Acts and Conſtitutions of this Kirk, and the oppoſing of the Publick Reſolutions, or the not acquieſcing to the Acts and Conſtitutions of the Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> is to be cenſured with the cenſures contained in the Act at <hi>Glaſgow, Dec.</hi> 18. Seſſ 28. 1638. Thus all the Miniſters, Elders and Expectants in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who do not acknowledge that Aſſembly, or oppoſe the Reſolutions thereof, or do not acquieſce to the Acts and Conſtitutions thereof, are to be laid aſide, diſcharged, ſilenced, ſuſpended or depoſed; yea all the Miniſters, Elders, Expectants and Profeſſors in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who do not acknowledge that Aſſembly, or who do oppoſe the Reſolutions thereof, or who do not acquieſce to the Acts and Conſtitutions thereof, are made lyable to excommunication, if after conference they do not receive ſatisfaction.</p>
                        <p>From what is already ſaid it doth appear who are the perſons (as to the matter of their ſuppoſed offence) are to be cenſured, I ſhall onely adde, that as to their reall qualification and carriage, that they are not ſuch who have been enemies, or diſ-affected to the Work of Reformation, or ſcandalous or looſe in their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, but ſuch as have been zealous thereof, and faithfull therein from the beginning, and blameleſſe in their converſation, and cannot acknowledge that Aſſembly, nor acquieſce to the Acts and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102069:73"/>thereof for conſcience ſake, having a well-warranted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion in themſelves, that they do herein walk according to former ſound principles, to depart from which were but to involve themſelves in the common defection with others. And as theſe perſons are ſo qualified in their carriage to the Publick Work, and in their converſation, ſo for their number they make up a very great part of the godly in the Land, whether Miniſters Elders, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectants or Profeſſors.</p>

                        <q>THe Generall Aſſembly being deeply affected with ſenſe of the many and ſad evils &amp; calamities that have already ariſen both to Kirk and State within this Land, by the lamentable diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſtractions amongſt Miniſters and others of the People of God in this Kirk, and apprehenſive of greater evils which may yet follow, to the over-throwing of the bleſſed Work of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, (which the Lord, in his great and ſpeciall mercy, was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſet up amongſt us, having carryed it through many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and oppoſitions) and to the laying of the Kirk of God waſte and deſolat, if theſe diviſions and diſtractions ſhal continue; And being moſt deſirous, as the Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Prince of Peace, to uſe all neceſſary and lawfull means (ſo far as their knowledge and power can reach) for preventing the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of theſe diviſions, and making up of the breaches.

                     <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                     <p>THis Overture, for the ſubſtance of it (as is hinted in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per it ſelf) was in the time of the ſitting of that Aſſembly communicated in a Conference by ſome of the Members thereof in the name of the reſt, unto ſome who were ſent from the Meeting of theſe who differ from the Publick Reſolutions; and being repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by theſe Brethren unto the reſt of their number, was taken in conſideration, and reaſons then given (which are herewith prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) ſhewing the unſatisfactorineſſe thereof, and why it could not be embraced; which reaſons are ſtill in force. I ſhall therefore now only deſire theſe two things to be taken notice of in this Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 1. That notwithſtanding of all the Solemne profeſſions of reall intentions and ſincere purpoſes of peace and of meekneſs, gentleneſs, moderation and condeſcendence, which are contained in this and others of their Papers, yet they not onely juſtifie and hold faſt all their former grounds and proceedings in reference to themſelves and their own judgments, but impoſe them alſo upon their Brethren (who differ from them, and have been ſo much ſtumbled therewith) as the onely mean of healing and of Peace. And therefore in reference to what is paſt, whoſoever have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in, or been acceſſory to the Proteſtation againſt theſe two Aſſemblies, muſt paſſe from the ſame judicially under their hands, between and the ſecond Wedneſday of <hi>November</hi> next enſuing in their ſeverall Presbyteries or Synods <hi>reſpective,</hi> and in order to the Publick Reſolutions, muſt give aſſurance in manner foreſaid, that they ſhall forbear to ſpeak or to teſtifie any more againſt the ſin of theſe which they expreſſe, by forbearing to hold up diviſions by debates, about matters of our late differences ſince the Aſſembly 1650. in preaching, writing, or any otherwiſe, and in reference to what is to come, the Acts of the Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> for cenſuring of all theſe who do not acknowledge the Conſtitution of that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, or who do oppoſe the Reſolutions, or who do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Acts and Conſtitutions thereof, ſtand unrepealed; to which, a new one in this Aſſembly at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> is added, excluding all Expectants and Ruling Elders, who refuſe the conditions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Overture. When I think upon theſe things, I can not but call to minde and lay before others to whom Union and Peace (which is ſo much pleaded and pretended) may and ought
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102069:75"/>to be ſweet and dear. 1. That which was ſpoken publickly in that Aſſembly at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> by one of their own Members, whilſt they were upon the debate of their Acts and Overtures about theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences; to wit, <hi>All the Reverend Brethren ſpeak for moderation, but I think we are very like thoſe in</hi> Micah, <hi>who cry peace peace and bite with their teeth,</hi> Micah. 3. v. 5.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The practice of our Prelates in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who after they had uſurped upon the Church, and brought in many of their corruptions did aggravate &amp; cry out of all the evils of diviſions, and ſchiſme, and much plead for, and make great profeſſions of a deſire of union and peace, that the Church might be ſtrengthened againſt the common enemy, by whom it was threatned with great danger, and againſt whom they did profeſſe much zeal, but ſo as they did alway hold faſt their corruptions, and go on therein from year to year, and would not yeeld to any other grounds of union and peace, but ſuch as did include the approbation of, and ſubjection to their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and proceedings, and yet did alwayes charge their Brethren who did bear teſtimony againſt their defection, and could not be conſenting to their courſes, as men of unpeaceable diſpoſitions, and turbulent ſpirits, who would rather rend the Church of GOD, and fill all with confuſion and diviſion, before they did not ſatisfie their own proud and contentious humours, in ſtriving (as they alledged) about things (of no great conſquence) relating to Church Policy, when there was no difference in matters of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; who ſo pleaſes to look upon the records of that corrupt Aſſembly at <hi>Lithgow</hi> 1608. will find that the Prelates and their party who prevailed in that Aſſembly, make a great deal of noiſe concerning the diſtractions of affections, and diverſity of judgments that was ariſen amongſt the Miniſtery, and upon the firſt of theſe they do inſiſt at length, holding it forth to be carnall, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay they, the more dangerous, becauſe it ſuffers not the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren whoſe affections were ſeparated to unite themſelves with ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fauld and uniforme counſels and advice to reſiſt the ſubtile practices of the common enemy, and ſo gave him place with his ſubtile crafts and ſhifts to enter into the Kirk of GOD, and thereby to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant and undermine the ſame: Therefore their adviſe is, that as the danger increaſes by the nouriſhing of the diſtracted affections of the Brethren, even ſo the cure was the more neceſſary, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102069:75"/>to be applied, to wit, that the whole Brethren of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery ſhould preſently in the fear of God lay down all rancour and diſtraction of hearts and affections which either of them hath born againſt others in any times, and be reconciled with hearty affection in CHRIST, as becomes them who are Miniſters of the Word of GOD, and Preachers of peace and Chriſtian life and charity to his people, to the effect that by this hearty reconciliation, hearts and advice may be communicate for diſappointing of the crafty deviſe of this common Enemy. But as to that which was the reall and firſt fountain of this diſtraction and difference of judgment, to wit, Miniſters voting in Parliament, their taking of Prelacies, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling conſtant Moderators; no acknowledging of theſe things as a ſin, or paſſing from them as corruptions, but holding them faſt, and building a further ſuperſtructure of declining upon them, whilſt in the mean time by their profeſſed forwardneſſe againſt Papiſts, who was then the enemy with whom the Church had to do, and the arguments taken from the benefite of union and peace, and the ſad conſequences, and bitter fruits of diſtraction and diviſion, and the ſmall importance of the things which were then in queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Brethren did prevail with many of the Miniſtery, not only to engage themſelves in a ſolemn way in the Aſſembly, and in their Presbyteries, with holding up of their hands to lay down and caſt away all grudge and rancour that any of them did bear at another, and to maintain union of hearts and affections, and to continue in mutuall friendſhip and holy amity in GOD, as becomes the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Kirk of Chriſt, (which was a thing in it ſelf very good and commendable) but alſo to be ſilent in all matters of difference about the Government and Diſcipline of the Kirk, by which it came to paſſe, leſt they ſhould thereby hinder union and peace, and weaken joynt endeavours againſt the common enemy, that whilſt the Shepheards were ſung aſleep, the foxes came in and deſtroyed the vines, which may give warning to all the Miniſters, Elders and Members of this Church who deſire to have the work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preſerved in purity, and promoved in power, that they be not as their fathers and Predeceſſors not long ago, charmed into ſilence by the ſweet ſongs of union and peace, untill they be cheated out of the precious Truth, and pure Ordinances of GOD, but that they take notice of, and reſiſt the beginnings of evill, by refuſing to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102069:76"/>be conſenting thereto, and concurring therein, though haply they ſhould becauſe of this, be cryed out on, as the troublers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and as theſe who weaken the hands of the Church againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy, by contending about things of no great importance.</p>
                     <p>The other thing which I take notice of in this Overture is, that notwithſtanding the authors and approvers thereof charge the Proteſters with laying of the grounds of ſeparation, and for making good their charge, do amongſt other grounds alledge, that though they be but the ſmaller and the fewer number, they take upon them to judge and act in the things of the Church, and to exerciſe juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and authority over their Brethren: Yet in this Overture this power ſeems to be given by the Aſſembly to the ſmaller part, or fewer number in Presbyteries or Synods who acknowledge the authority of theſe two Aſſemblies at <hi>Dundee</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both in the matter of propounding the Overture, and in the matter of reporting of diligence, and in after doings, the ſame things are committed and intruſted to the fewer or ſmaller number which are committed &amp; intruſted to the whole, or greater part of the Presbytery or Synod. It is true that they ordain them to do as they find by the rule of the Word, and the Acts and Conſtitutions of the Gen. Aſſemblies of this Kirk to be moſt neceſſary and conduceable for preſervation of Truth, for promoving the peace and welfare of the Kirk, and maintaining of the authority of the Aſſemblies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but yet puts a reſtriction upon the ſmaller part to proceed even to cenſures againſt the greater part, but onely layes down the rule according to which they ought to proceed, and the ends which they ought to have before them in their procedures when they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed unto, or abſtain from cenſures, as ſeems to be clear by their way of Expreſſion; and to confirm that this is the meaning, I deſire it to be conſidered: Firſt, that if they had an other meaning it had been eaſie for them to expreſſe it in ſuch words as would have holden forth their ſenſe clearly and unqueſtionably. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, theſe limitations which they uſe as to the matter of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, are equally holden forth both to the greater and ſmaller part of Presbyteries and Synods. Thirdly, They did take notice of the ſmaller parts of Presbyteries in ſeverall places of the Country who had withdrawn and ſeparated from the greater part, and acted Presbyterially, and apart by themſelves, not onely without the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102069:76"/>concurrance and conſent, but againſt the Authority and declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the greater part, yea they did receive Commiſſioners from ſome of them, and admitted them to ſit as Members of their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. Fourthly, they gave Commiſſions for over-powering the greater part in ſome Presbyteries, that Churches might be plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and things done contrary to the minde of the greater part. If notwithſtanding of theſe things, or any thing that is intended in the Overture it ſelf, they will vindicate it from ſuch a meaning; I believe it ſhall be acceptably taken off their hands, but untill it be done, I wiſh none of them may charge the Proteſters with ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon that ground for which they themſelves, to the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Proteſters, have both in their acts and practice clearly paved the way.</p>

                        <q>VVE, being met in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> at the time appointed by the former Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee,b</hi> of purpoſe to ſtudy the healing of begun breaches in this Kirk, were interrupted at our firſt down-ſitting, and hindered from conſtitution of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly by our Diſſenting Brethren their offer of Propoſitions and deſires to be granted by us, which could not to any good purpoſe, <hi rend="sup">c</hi> either be debated or effectually granted, as was required, before the Aſſembly was conſtitute, and the Judicatory fixed. Which ſhort delay of our anſwer, till we were in capacity to anſwer,<hi rend="sup">d</hi> was met with a Proteſtation, prepared before hand, for a declinatour of the Judicatory, and all the Commiſſioners of Presbyteries,<hi rend="sup">e</hi> as freelychoſen as any were, and ſent forth from all parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. In which Proteſtation were contained<hi rend="sup">f</hi> many grievous and unjuſt aſperſions upon us and others (who dare not paſs from the poſſeſſion of<hi rend="sup">g</hi> yearly Generall Aſſemblies; which, being in former times interrupted, was purchaſed at a dear rate, before it was recovered)<hi rend="sup">h</hi> and all this was preſently put in Print, to the great diſadvantage of us, and miſ-information of all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102069:77"/>After the Aſſembly was conſtitute,<hi rend="sup">i</hi> a conference was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by us, wherein ſome from us deſired, That to the intent we might joyn the better for promoving the Work of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, legall bars hindering us from peace, to wit, Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the one hand, and Cenſures inflicted, or which might be inflicted, on the other hand, being removed. They ſhould give aſſurance to forbear to trouble the Kirk, by holding up de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates on the matter of our late Differences, about the managing of Publick Affairs.<hi rend="sup">k</hi> But after conference, finding no ground of hope for preſent agreement, we have made the ſame offer to all them who adhered to the Proteſtation, whether in the Town for the time, or not, as our Act (the Copy whereof is with theſe come to your hands) at more length doth declare, and granted unto all, time to adviſe till the ſecond Wedneſday of <hi>November</hi> next to come. And now becauſe our Diſſenting <hi rend="sup">l</hi> Brethren have the advantage of the Preſs for the preſent, and and are too too diligent and painfull in gathering of hands and ſubſcriptions to their Proteſtation, of young men or elder, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or ſervants, without any tryall of their qualification, to <hi rend="sup">n</hi> make the world think, that the generality of the godly (as they in their Papers preſume to call themſelves) and that in great number do ſtand for their diviſive way, <hi rend="sup">o</hi> Therefore we thought it our duty to write unto you all, who love the Union and Peace of this afflicted Kirk, that by your counſell, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and all other godly means, ſo many as in your bounds, Miniſters, or others, are upon this diviſive way, which tendeth ſo much to the hinderance of the Work of Reformation, and peace of the LORDS diſtreſſed people may be timouſly reclaimed, and moved to accept the peaceable offer made to them by the Generall Aſſembly, and the reſt within your bounds may be keeped free from this<hi rend="sup">p</hi> uncouth ſeparation, that it grow not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi rend="sup">q</hi> and that difference of judgment about the managing of publick affairs in our late troubles, which occaſioned this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy rupture, may be no prejudice to our joynt acting in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick Judicatories, for keeping the Liberties thereof, and the peace of this Kirk, which at this time doth ſo much call for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of counſels and actings: Wherein as you ſhall prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall, you ſhall be found to do a work of ſervice unto

                     <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                     <p>A. It ſufficeth not the authors and abbettors of the Publick Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions who were Members of that Aſſembly to have ſtirred up the Civil Magiſtrate againſt their Brethren, and to have made acts in the Commiſſion where theſe Reſolutions were firſt taken, firſt requiring Presbyteries to cenſure the oppoſers thereof, then to cite them to the Aſſembly, and in theſe two Aſſemblies for excluding and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving them from all Eccleſiaſtick imployment, from Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowſhip; but they muſt now for enſnaring of them or rendering them contemptible and hatefull throughout the land, write this Letter to Noblemen, Barrons, &amp;c. in all the parts of the Country.</p>
                     <p>The direction or inſcription is comprehenſive (which is alſo proven by the deliverance of theſe Letters to ſundry ſuch in ſeverall parts of the Country, and by their ſtickling upon the receipt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) even of many of theſe whoſe admittance to Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to power and truſt, is the great ground of the Proteſters ſtumbling and grievance; I mean many malignant and diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected perſons, who being formerly excluded were received by the Commiſſion 1650. without ſufficient evidences of their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and are cleaving unto their former bad Principles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in their former evill courſes, muſt theſe be firſt admitted without repentance, and then whilſt they are proclaiming their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency to the whole Land by their evil fruits, be ſent to reclaim ſuch who did bear teſtimony againſt receiving of them; ſurely this is a ſtrange method, and if there had not been a turning of things up-ſide down it would not have been thus.</p>
                     <p>B. That ſome of them had ſuch a purpoſe I do not queſtion, but that the greater part had it, is not like. 1. Becauſe at their former Meeting at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the twelfth of <hi>May,</hi> they did refuſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the indicting the Diet of their Aſſembly for a few dayes, until
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102069:78"/>ſome conſiderable number of thoſe who did differ from them might be advertiſed to meet: Notwithſtanding that, it was earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, to the effect that by mutual previous conference ſome right underſtanding might have been begotten, and way made for the chuſing of Commiſſioners and ſitting of an Aſſembly, with the mutual conſent and ſatisfaction of both. 2. Becauſe it being moſt earneſtly deſired, and the Reaſons thereof at large remonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them the firſt day of their Meeting, that they would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to conſtitute themſelves in an Aſſembly, until firſt there might be a Conference upon theſe Propoſitions. (which deſire and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance they do here ſuppreſſe, putting another face upon the buſineſſe) yet did they refuſe the ſame, notwithſtanding that the preſent conſtituting of the Aſſembly was to make the matter hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and to put us upon the neceſſity of a Proteſtation, unleſſe by our ſilence being preſent, we would have involved our ſelves in the acknowledgment of an unlawful Authority: and notwithſtanding that the delay was preſſed by ſome of their own number, and that it might have been condeſcended unto, without any detriment to themſelves, or their cauſe, (unleſſe it had been two or three dayes longer ſtay in town) ſeeing they could conveniently according to the ſundry former inſtances of that kind, which were then given, have kept their Aſſembly under adjournment, though not conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.</p>
                     <p>C. They might have been debated and granted to very good purpoſe before the Aſſembly was conſtituted, and the Judicatorie fixed; becauſe the debating and granting of them in an amicable way, and in a mutual free Meeting of both, was the moſt effectual means of removing differences and begetting a right underſtanding, and ſo of having a free and lawful General Aſſembly, which would have produced an unanimous and effectual Concluſion upon theſe Propoſitions, whereas to refuſe to Debate, or grant any thing by way of friendly conference, or conſtituting of the Aſſembly, and fixing of the Judicatories, was in effect to deny theſe Propoſitions and make them ineffectual, becauſe a main intent of theſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was, to find a remedy for the wrong conſtitution of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> and for preventing of the like now at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which was altogether diſappointed by their proceeding to conſtitute the Aſſembly.</p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:102069:78"/>
                     <p>D. There was a neceſſity of a Proteſtation, becauſe the deſire of delaying the conſtitution of the Aſſembly, until there might be a previous conference, was ſo peremptorily and needleſly rejected.</p>
                     <p>E. The choice was not free, becauſe the Letter of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from their Meeting at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> did contain a pre-limitation, appointing the election to be made according to a rule, which did include the Acts and Conſtitutions of the Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> which do exclude all that are oppoſit to the Publick Reſolutions; and becauſe there were diſſents and proteſtations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the election in ſeveral places, neither were they ſent forth from all parts of the Kingdom, becauſe there were many Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries who did ſend forth no Commiſſioners at all.</p>
                     <p>F. Whether there were any grievous aſperſions, and unjuſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations contained in that Proteſtation, doth appear from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that is given to the Paper, wherein thoſe pretended aſperſions and imputations are holden forth.</p>
                     <p>G. Yearly General Aſſemblies, rightly conſtituted, and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding rightly, are as much and as earneſtly deſired by the Proteſters as by any others; and from the deſire which they have to preſerve the liberty and freedom of theſe, they do bear teſtimony againſt the pre-limiting and corrupting thereof.</p>
                     <p>H. Nothing was put in print by order of the Meeting, nor was it at all done, until there was no hopes to obtain what was deſired: And what was printed, though it might be to their diſadvantage, yet was it not the diſadvantage of the Truth, or miſ-informing of the Kingdom; but for giving them a true accompt of matters as they then were, and though by the order of narration which they do here make, they inſinuate that things came out in print before the Conference ended, which they afterwards mention, yet was nothing publiſhed in print, until that Conference was given up and made hopeleſs.</p>
                     <p>I. They alleage, That a Conference was offered by them; but they neither tell when, nor how, nor to whom it was offered; and I beleeve it would trouble them ſo to do, for they did keep ſuch a diſtance that they would neither ſend nor allow any of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to motion a Conference to their Brethren who were met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but deſired ſome of their number to tell ſuch of them as they met with upon the ſtreets, that they were willing to confer; and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102069:79"/>when at length there was ſome meeting of ſome few of both ſides, thoſe of that Aſſembly, who were upon the Conference, could by no perſwaſion nor reaſon be induced to give any note of their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures in writing, though it was often and earneſtly deſired, that being clearly communicated to the whole Meeting of Proteſters, they might return a clear Anſwer thereunto.</p>
                     <p>K. Why this deſire was not hearkened unto, good and relevant reaſon, is given in another Paper long ſince printed and publiſhed.</p>
                     <p>L. That advantage at that time, for any thing their Brethren know, was open to both alike, and did appear immediatly thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be ſo by their Papers againſt the Remonſtrance and Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which came abroad in print.</p>
                     <p>M. There was no diligence nor pains uſed to gather any Hands to their Proteſtation, only thoſe who were come together from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the Country from their reſpect and affection to the Cauſe (many of which came commiſſionated from others) did put to their Hands; and for that which they ſay of yong-men, or el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, maſters or ſervants, without any tryal or qualification, it is a little diſdainfully and too liberally ſpoken; there were many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and grave perſons there, and though ſome were young-men or ſervants, yet is that no imputation either to themſelvs, or to the cauſe which they maintain: for it's neither mens age nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that doth difference them in the matters of God, but their qualification and carriage which is known to be blameleſs and chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as to thoſe who ſubſcribed the Proteſtation; and if they can give any inſtance to the contrary, I beleeve the Proteſters will take it for a favour to have any inordinate walker of their number diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered unto them, &amp; ſhall accompt it not the weakening, but the ſtrengthening of their Cauſe to be rid of ſuch; yea, at that Meeting where the Proteſtation was ſubſcribed, it was their care to admit none to joyn with them, but ſuch as were of a known integrity, or if not ſo well known to all, yet ſuch as had the teſtimonie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who were known to all; and being ſuch, how mean ſoever their condition was, that could not be a reaſon or ground to refuſe their teſtimony, when it was willingly offered.</p>
                     <p>N. Albeit a great deal adoe is made upon that expreſſion, yet there is truth in the bottom of it, moſt of theſe in the Land, who have a teſtimony in the conſciences of truly godly Miniſters or
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102069:79"/>Profeſſors either upon the one ſide or the other, for acquaintance with God and the power of godlineſſe, being of that mind; and if this expreſſion ſatisfie not, that the generality of the godly ſtand for that diviſive way, I ſhall give them one that they can leſſe contradict, that is, that the generality of the wicked are againſt that diviſive way, and for their uniting way; yea, I trow that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men among themſelves will not refuſe it, that the wicked, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, looſe, prophane perſons in the Land, almoſt to a man, and as one man, do zealouſly, and to their p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>th, oppoſe, and contradict and reproach that diviſive way, and cordially promote and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their uniting way, or the way of theſe two Aſſemblies at <hi>Dundee</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and though this argument be now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued, yet was it wont to bear weight in the 48 year of God againſt the unlawfull engagement. And, I confeſſe, with me is of a very great weight. That which reliſheth ſo well to the palate of prophane looſe men, and of ſuch as have zealouſly oppoſed the Work of God, and the power of godlineſſe theſe years paſt, and wherein their hearts doth ſo much rejoyce, I fear, hath too much of the ſpirit of the world, &amp; too litle of the ſpirit of God in it.</p>
                     <p>O. This way doth not divide from any point of the truth of God, but leads in the good old path of former found principles, and cannot be juſtly charged as diviſive becauſe it will not unite with a courſe of defection, and therefore there can be no juſt reaſon to ſay, that it tends to the hindering of Reformation and Peace. The true fountain of our diviſions doth ſpring from the Publick Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, which divided many from received truths and former principles, and did neceſſitate others to evidence their cleaving thereto, by teſtifying againſt ſuch back-ſliding; neither know I any thing that hath ſo directly tended to the hinderance of the Work of Reformation as their Publick Reſolutions did. The Work of Reformation, as to the outwards of it in Church and State, did much ſtand in purging the Miniſterie and Elderſhips, and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories and the Army, and have not all theſe been obſtructed by the Publick Reſolutions, which laid a foundation for bringing into the Army and the Judicatories, men of queſtionable integrity, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to Reformation, and of ſcandalous converſation, and hath not onely blunted, but turned the edge of any zeal that was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly bent againſt ignorant, diſ-affected and ſcandalous Miniſters
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102069:80"/>and Elders, and Profeſſours, againſt theſe who cannot be conſenting to the late courſes.</p>
                     <p>P. Separation and Schiſme hath been the ordinary charge of back-ſliders, againſt ſuch as would not concur with them in every age of the Church, and ſome of the moſt eminent of theſe who are now for the Publick Reſolutions, may remember, that they were not only loaden herewith by the Prelats, when they did oppoſe the courſe of conformity, but alſo by all the Malignant and diſ-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected perſons in the Land, when they did oppoſe the courſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancie; but to ſay nothing, that this Aſſembly at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> have taught the Proteſters a way of ſeparation, which they cannot well condemne, unleſſe they condemne their own judgment and practice, I mean, the allowing of the ſmaller part, not only to divide from the greater, but alſo to act without them, and exerciſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them. I deſire 1. that they will be pleaſed to let the world know what truth that hath been taught in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> either concerning Faith, or good Works, or Worſhip, or Diſcipline, or Government, they have departed or ſeparated from. Is it a ſeparation, becauſe they will not approve of, nor ſubmit unto the authority of two corrupt and unfree Aſſemblies. 2. I deſire it to be conſidered, that whatſoever be in the matter of ſeparation, the Proteſters are not <hi>ſeparantes</hi> but <hi>ſeparati,</hi> not <hi>fugientes</hi> but <hi>fugati,</hi> they are driven violently by unjuſt cenſures and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as I have already ſhewen from the Publick Acts.</p>
                     <p>Q. If they be indeed of the opinion, that difference of judgment in theſe things ſhould be no prejudice to joynt acting in Publick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories, then it concernes them for their own vindication, and for reconciling their practice with their opinion, to tell us why their Aſſembly at <hi>S. Andrews</hi> did not onely approve of the Act of Commiſſion, appointing thoſe who oppoſe the Publick Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be cenſured, but alſo made Acts of their own for cenſuring of ſuch; and why the Aſſembly at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> did ordain, That Elders and Expectants, who will not engage themſelves under their hands, to abſtain from holding up this difference, are to be excluded from ſitting in Presbyteries, and being received as Miniſters; ſure if this difference need be no prejudice to joynt acting in Publick Judicatories, the maintaining thereof is without ground made a cauſe of cenſure, which muſt incapacitat men to act, or of excluſion,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102069:80"/>which muſt bar them from joynt acting in Judicatories, what ſhal be ſaid to this, I do not know, unleſſe it be alleaged, that it is not ſimply difference of judgment, that is made a ground of cenſure or excluſion, but difference of judgment kythed in oppoſing the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reſolutions, or holding up debates and controverſies in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or writing about theſe things; but firſt, if it be meant of that difference of judgment that is inward onely, it is to ſmall purpoſe, becauſe that being latent and not known to me, cannot be made a ground for my with-drawing from joynt acting with theſe who thus differ from me: and if it be known and profeſſed, how ſhall there be any known difference of judgment, without ſome oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the adverſe judgment, eſpecially if it be eſtabliſhed in a Law, he who profeſſes and declares the difference of his judgement from the Law, and diſ-ſatisfaction therewith, is he not in ſo far, a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, gainſayer, and oppoſer thereof. 2. If they mean it thus, they have not meaſured the ſame meaſure unto themſelves and to others; they will have others to paſſe from their Proteſtations under their hands, and to engage themſelves not to hold up de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, otherwiſe they will not act joyntly with them in the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories, nor allow them the legall capacity to act at all, and yet while they will do no ſuch things themſelves in reference to their Aſſemblies and the Acts thereof, yea, will have theſe Aſſemblies to ſtand as free and lawfull, and all the Acts thereof, wherein their judgment is involved, as binding and obligatory, they deſire that their Brethren may be dealt with, not to let this hinder them from a joynt acting in the Publick Judicatories. 3. If it be onely the oppoſing of Publick Reſolutions, and the holding up of debates that they quarrell with, how is it that in Presbyteries they will have young men who have hitherto been ſilent, publickly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves anent theſe things, or elſe refuſe to admit them to their tryals, or to ſtop them being admitted, or to refuſe them Teſtimonials being approven.</p>

                     <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                     <p>This Act (as is profeſſed and given out by many) was not only intended, but if they may be truſted, doth indeed and upon the matter give full and clear ſatisfaction to the Propoſitions which were offered by the Proteſters unto their Brethren of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102069:82"/>Aſſembly at their firſt down-ſitting, as the beſt means for ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their conſciences, ſecuring of the Work of Reformation, purging the Church, promoving the power of godlineſſe, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of theſe ſad differences, and for attaining and preſerving a good underſtanding, and therefore theſe (as they alleadge being ſatisfied) the propounders of them not acquieſcing therein, muſt have ſome other thing before them: Therefore for vindicating of theſe, I ſhal mark a few things for ſhewing how unſatisfactory all that is contained in this Act is, unto the deſires contained in theſe Propoſitions, untill there may be opportunity to make a more full diſcovery thereof. 1. To paſſe the ambiguity of their Anſwer to the firſt part of the firſt Propoſition, wherein it is deſired that they give evidence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They omit the whole ſecond Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to wit, That it be ſeriouſly laid to heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in order to the ends that are propounded in the Preface to theſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to wit, the ſatisfaction of our Conſciences, is as to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition of affairs betwixt them and the Proteſters, the moſt important of theſe Propoſitions, yea in their other Papers theſe things which the Proteſters complain of as defection, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend as duty, and profeſſe their adherence thereunto, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point cenſures to be inflicted upon all the oppoſers thereof.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They alſo omit the whole third Propoſition, to wit, That as we are ready in our ſtation, &amp;c. by which ommiſſion they give juſt ground to ſuſpect, that there is in their apprehenſion no malignant party that needs to be diſcovered, or from whom the Work of God ſtands in danger; and though the Proteſters do not in the firſt part of the Propoſition take upon them to ſecure and guard the Cauſe and Work of God againſt errour hereſie and ſchiſme, but onely by this Overture gave evidence of the ſincerity of their intentions in order to that end, that ſo they may ſatisfie their Brethren in the matter of their Jealouſies thereanent, yet as they do ſtill apprehend a great danger to the Lords Work from a numerous party of malignants ſtill in the Lord, ſo are they much unſatisfied that the Aſſembly gave no expreſſion of their ſenſe of danger this way, nor evidence of their willingneſſe to concur in ſecuring againſt the ſame, nor hold forth any way for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and knowing of theſe for the time to come.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Whereas they ſeem to grant much in order to the trying,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102069:83"/>admitting, removing, and depoſing of Church-Officers, cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſcandalous perſons, diſpenſing of Ordinances, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of penitents, they do really and in effect grant little or nothing; yea they do expreſly refuſe the deſire of the Propoſitions upon theſe things, and eſtabliſh the very contrary: Becauſe the deſire of the Propoſitions is, that the late Meeting at <hi>Dundee</hi> and the Acts thereof being taken out of the way, and the Work and People of GOD ſecured from the harm and evill conſequences which have already, and may further enſue from the ſame, as is expreſſed in the laſt Propoſition (which they wholly omit) all theſe things may be done according to the Acts of former uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Aſſemblies of this Church, concerning the Work of Reformation in the literall and genuine ſenſe and meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but their grants and conceſſions do include for the rule, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which they are to be regulated, <hi>viz.</hi> the Acts of General Aſſemblies, and Conſtitutions of this Church indefinitely, which in their ſenſe doth clearly and undeniably include the Acts of the laſt Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which inſtead of purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church from ignorant and diſaffected and ſcandalous Miniſters and Profeſſors purge it from a very great part of the able well affected &amp; good Miniſters, Elders, Expectants, and Profeſſors of the Land, becauſe of their not acknowledging the authority, and acquieſcing to the Conſtitutions of theſe Aſſemblies.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Their actions (which before the Lord, and alſo with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent and diſcerning men, are the moſt reall evidences of the reallity and ſincerity of mens intentions) ſince that time do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, whether they have granted the deſire of theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions: Tell me how many ignorant, diſaffected, ſcandalous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters or Elders, are cenſured by the Authors of the Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions ſince the laſt Aſſembly, or how many lawfully depoſed and unlawfully admitted are proceeded againſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They would fain find ſome ſhadow of an excuſe for ſo groſſe an overſight, and caſt the blame upon the Proteſters, who ſay they have ſo weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the authority of the Church, that her cenſures are rendered altogether ineffectuall. But 1. To ſay nothing that ſpirituall cenſures are not alwayes to be foreborn, becauſe men refuſe to obey; yea in many caſes they are the more vigorouſly to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted. 2. With what colour of reaſon can it be alleadged that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102069:83"/>thoſe who not onely acknowledge their authority, but very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly pleading for it, as moſt of the ſcandalous and diſaffected Miniſters and Elders of the Land do, will not ſubmit unto it. 3. It is time for them to plead, that excuſe when they meet with that difficulty; tell me how many of that kind can be inſtanced whom they have not cenſured, who have not ſubmitted to their cenſures. 4. The not ſubmitting to their cenſures doth not hinder them to proceed very zealouſly againſt ſundry Miniſters, and many Elders who adhere unto the Proteſtation and bear teſtimony againſt the Publick Reſolutions? Let Conſciences ſpeak as before the Lord, whether they have faithfully and zealouſly improven the power and authority that remains with them in Synods, Presbyteries and Seſſions for purging of the houſe of God, even according to theſe things which they ſeem to grant, or whether they have not been negligent exceedingly in this, to ſay no worſe, and imployed moſt of their endeavours and zeal to bear down the Proteſters.</p>

                     <head>REASONS why the <hi>Miniſter, Elders,</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> who proteſted againſt the Pretended Aſſemblies as St. <hi>Andrews, Dundee</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> cannot agree to the Overtures made unto them at the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, upon the 28. and 29 of <hi>July,</hi> 1652. &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>ALbeit the Eſſayes and Endeavors which were uſed by us, before our coming hither, for removing of Differences, and attaining of Union and Peace, upon ſuch grounds as might (indeed) bring forth a diſcovery of our, and the Lands Sin, and contribute for removing the guilt thereof, and for ſecuring and promoving the Work of Reformation amongſt us, might in a great part have arquited our conſciences, and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us before the world; yet the deep ſenſe that we had of the many and great prejudices which do enſue to the Work and People of God, by our continued Diviſions, and our ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Peace and Union, upon the grounds foreſaid, conſtrained us to lay hold upon the opportunity of your meeting together at this time, and to repreſent unto you, ſome neceſſary and juſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102069:84"/>as a fit ſubject of our conference; and that we were willing to hear what ſhould be offered by you to us, in order to theſe ends; and, that therefore you would forbear to aſſume un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ſelves the power of, or conſtitute your ſelves into a Gen. Aſſembly. And when we found this in-effectual, and our Union rendred more hopeleſs, by your denying a deſire ſo juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and ſo agreeable to the practice of former Aſſemblies, as was inſtanced before you by theſe who knew the Records: Nevertheleſs upon a ſurmiſe of a purpoſe in you to confer with us, we did for divers dayes wait upon you, being deſirous to have ſeen upon your part, ſome ſerious applying of your ſelves to the real means of healing, and to have found ſolid ſatisfaction unto the things contained in the Propoſitions offered to you by us: But in place of this, the Brethren who were appointed by you to confer with ſome of our number, did intimate unto us, that all which they had in Commiſſion to make offer of, was, That ye were willing to take-off the Cenſures inflicted by the former Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Dundee,</hi> and the Cenſurableneſs that perſons, who have tranſgreſſed againſt the Acts thereof might be liable unto: Providing, that theſe Brethren cenſured, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Cenſure, ſhould paſs from their Proteſtation againſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and preſent Aſſemblies, and judicially before their Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Synods, engage themſelves under their hands, not hereafter to deliver their Judgments in Preaching or Writing, or any way elſe to hold up the late differences. Which Overture when it was earneſtly deſired by theſe of our number to be given to them in writing according to their Inſtructions, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was divers wayes repreſented by ſuch of your number as did confer with them, but alſo that they might the more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and better underſtands the ſame, and be able to make an exact report thereof to theſe who ſent them, and miſtakes thereupon might be Prevented: It was moſt peremptorily refuſed, albeit moſt earneſtly urged and deſired during the whole time of the Conference: Therefore having ſet down the ſame as truely and impartially as our judgments and memories could attain; We do for our own vindication, and ſatisfaction of others, give theſe Reaſons following, why we cannot accept thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>1. Becauſe there is hereby no remedy at all offered for the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102069:84"/>courſe of defection involved in the Publick Reſolutions, nor for preventing the like for time to come, which is the main ground of difference; but upon the contrary we are required upon the matter to retract our Teſtimonies thereanent, and judicially to give Bonds and Engagements hereafter to be ſilent concerning the ſin and guilt thereof.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>II. Becauſe our paſſing from our Proteſtant doth import a real acknowledgement of the lawfulneſs and freedom of the Aſſemblies in regard of their conſtitution, and of power in them to inflict and take-off Cenſures, and ſo by our own conſent, doth not only retract and condemn the teſtimony which we former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave againſt the ſame; But alſo obſtructeth the remeading of what is paſt, and the attaining a lawful, free, General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for the time to come, and ſo wreaths about our own neck, and the necks of the Lords People, the yoke of unfree, corrupt, and unlawful Aſſemblies.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>III. Becauſe the offer which is made, though it contains Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity in regard of theſe who have not a quieſced unto, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed theſe Acts for the time paſt, yet the Acts of themſelves do not withſtanding thereof, ſtill ſtand in force, as a ground of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution againſt all theſe Miniſters and Profeſſors, who ſhall not accept of the conditions contained in this offer, or thereafter fail in performance of the ſame.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>IV. Becauſe this offer is ſo far from reaching ſatisfaction to all, or moſt part of the Propoſitions offered by us, that it doth not give ſatisfaction to any one of them, put pitcheth upon a particular, which ought to be of leaſt conſequence with us, (as importing but our perſonal ſuffering) without taking notice of the Lands defection, and of thoſe things which do concern the Kingdom and Intereſt of JESUS CHRIST, and the purging of his Houſe; and what a ſin and provocation ſhould it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord, and what a ſtumbling and grief of heart unto the godly who have concurred in theſe Propoſitions, and after ſuch a defection, do expect repentance and reformation, and the purging of his Houſe of corrupt Officers and Members, if we ſhould make ſuch a tranſaction, as ſeems to promiſe preſent ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecurity to our ſelves, but doth not contri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <q>V. We cannot ſee how the paſſing from theſe Propoſitions, and the taking upon us ſuch Engagements for the time to come as are deſired, ſhould not involve us in the condemning of our own judgments, and in the acknowledgment of a ſin and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in making theſe Proteſtations, and bearing teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Publick Reſolutions, and import that what is done by you in taking off of Cenſures and cenſurableneſs (as you term it) is an Act of meet favour and grace upon your part, unto De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, upon their repentance. And though we hope that we ſhall never be aſhamed, but eſteem it our mercy and glory to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any thing whereby we have provoked the Lord, or offended others, yet being more and more convinced in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that what we did in theſe things was a neceſſary duty, we dare not purchaſe immunity and exemption from Cenſures at ſo dear a rate, as to deny the ſame, we ſhall rather chooſe ſtill to be ſufferers, and to wait upon the iſſue that the Lord ſhall give, then to provoke the eyes of his Glory, grieve the ſpirits of his People, and would our own Conſciences, by ſo unſatisfying and ſo ſinful a tranſaction.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And conceiving that, we ſhall not have the opportunity to ſpeak unto you hereafter, as being now about to diſſolve our Meeting; We do from the zeal that we owe to the honour of God, and from the tender reſpect we owe to you as Brethren, and for exonering our own Conſcience, moſt earneſtly beſeech and obteſt you, by your appearing before the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to give your ſelves unto Prayer, and ſearching of your own hearts and way, in Order to Publick Reſolutions and Actions, untill each of you finde out wherein ye have turned aſide from the ſtraight way of the Lord, and imployed your gifts and power not for Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but for grieving the ſpirits of many of the Godly, and ſtrengthening of the hands of the wicked, and to Repent thereof, and to do no more ſo, leaſt wrath be increaſed from the LORD, the Godly of the Land more offended, and our breach made wider, and our wound more incurable. If both you and we might obtain mercy of the Lord to know our treſpaſſe, and why he contends, and to accept the puniſhment of our iniquity, and humble our ſelves before hime, who knoweth but that he might yet have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion upon us, and pardon our ſins, and heal our Land.</p>

                           <hi>III.</hi> That they do not engage in Conference with them at first about the matter of Cenſures; It being neither the chief nor only ground of our grievance; and becauſe with us things of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and any thing of perſonal concernment, ought to be of the ſmalleſt value, while there are many things in queſtion betwixt them and us, of far higher conſequence to the Kingdom of Chriſt and his Intereſt, as anent the cauſes of Gods controverſie with the Land, and the way of remedy and cure of the former and late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and the way of preventing the like in time coming. The eſtabliſhing and promoving the Work of Reformation, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Kirk, and the like, as are laid before them in our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions given in to their Meeting; And that they do intimate to the Brethren foreſaid, that we cannot look upon an offer rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely to the Cenſures, upon ſome of our number, as ſatisfaction to them or us, and that (beſides what we have ſaid) for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be communicated in due time to their Meeting. And that therefore they ſhall offer to theſe Brethren, and deſire of them, that if there be any Conference at all, the ſubject matter of it may be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102069:86"/>upon the whole Propoſitions in the order as they ſtand.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>IV.</hi> That in caſe of their refuſing the latter part of the former Article, they ſhall require and demand from the Brethren of the other Meeting, That they would declare whether we may expect, that theſe from whom they were ſent, will either by the ſaid Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, or any other way, give anſwer and ſatisfaction to us anent the Propoſitions, and what is their ſenſe and meaning of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reſolutions, and anent the Conſtitution, Acts, and Proceedings of the Meeting at <hi>Dundee,</hi> and of this at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and what they minde to do in reference to the ſame.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>V.</hi> That in caſe there be not ſatisfaction obtained in theſe ſo juſt and neceſſary things, They do profeſſe their own and our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction with any thing that hath been offered by them to us, or anſwered to our deſires firſt or laſt. And that they proteſt for themſelves and us, That as we have ſought Peace, and purſued it by all lawfull and poſſible means, though much in vain on their part. So we are henceforth free from the guilt and blame of the ſad pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and evil conſequences whatſomever, which may follow upon their preſent way, and their former and future actings of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo contrary and deſtructive to Edification and Peace.</item>

                     <p>WHereas we, and many of the godly in the Land have been really ſcandalized and ſtumbled at their late Acts and Proceedings, relating to Publick Reſolutions concerning the ſame in the nature and Intention of the Work, to have obſtructed and ſhaken the Work of Reformation (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we think honourably of diverſe Godly and Learned men who have been concurring in the ſame, and dare not judge their Intentions to be ſuch as we think their Work hath bee, and do allow charity to others.) Therefore for ſatisfaction of or conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and for ſecuring the Work of Reformation, for purging the Church, and for pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>moving the power of godlineſſe, and for remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of theſe ſad differences, and for attaining and preſerving a good underſtanding, We deſire,</p>
                     <p>That they give evidence and aſſurance, that they approve of, and will adhere unto the ſolemn Publick Confeſſion of ſins and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to duties, and all the Acts of the uncontroverted Aſſemblies of this Church, concerning the Work of Reformation, in the literal and genuine ſenſe and meaning thereof. And that in diſpenſing of the Ordinances, cenſuring of ſcandalous perſons, receiving of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents, trying, admitting, removing and depoſing of Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, they will walk according to the ſame. That it be laid ſeriouſly to heart before the LORD, how after ſuch a defection, and ſo ſad judgments for it, the LORD may be reſtored to his honor, the Land to his favor, and the like defection prevented in time coming.</p>
                     <p>That as we are ready in our ſtation, to follow all religious and conſcionable means and Overtures for ſecuring and guarding the Cauſe and Work of GOD againſt Error, Hereſie and Schiſme on the one hand, ſo they would hold out to us a ſolid way for ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſame againſt dangers from Malignancy on the other. And we would know what ſhall be the Characters in time coming, by which Malignancy may be known and judged.</p>
                     <p>That a reall and effectuall courſe be taken, according to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102069:87"/>rules of this Kirk, for purging out, and holding out all ſuch Church-Officers as have not the Poſition, and qualifications re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Word of God, &amp; Acts of this Kirk; partiularly, where Miniſters depoſed by lawfull Aſſemblies, have intruded themſelves, or have been unwarrantably reſtored by Synods and Presbyteries to their Charges, contrary to the form and order preſcribed in the Acts of Aſſemblies, be romoved, and condign cenſures inflicted, and that ſufficient Proviſion be made for preventing the like in time coming.</p>
                     <p>That after means be fallen upon and followed for cenſuring of all ſcandals and ſcandalous perſons, and caſting out of theſe who ſhall be found groſly and obſtinatly ſcandalous or ignorant, after they are made inexcuſable by ſufficient means and pains taken for their inſtructing and reclaiming.</p>
                     <p>That ſome courſe more effectuall than any hath been fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hitherto, may be condeſcended upon, for putting in execution the Acts of this Kirk, anent debarring from the Lord's Table ſuch perſons who are found not to walk ſuteably to the Goſpel, and have not knowledge to examine themſelves, and to diſcerne the Lord's Body.</p>
                     <p>That in the receiving of Penitents, care may be had that none be admitted to the publick Profeſſion of repentance, or reconciled to the Church, but theſe who are found to give ſuch evidence of their repentance, as is expreſt in the Acts of the Aſſemblies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the receiving of Penitents.</p>
                     <p>That an effectual courſe may be taken for ſecuring of the Work and People of GOD from the harm and evill conſequences which hath already, and may further enſue from the late pretended Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies at <hi>S.
